Let's call a directed graph egg-free if it is acyclic and for any three pairwise distinct vertices xx, yy and zz, if the graph contains edges x→yx→y and x→zx→z, then it also contains an edge y→zy→z and/or an edge z→yz→y.
You are given an undirected graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges (numbered 11 through MM). Find a way to assign a direction to each of its edges such that the resulting directed graph is egg-free, or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi denoting an edge between vertices uiui and vivi.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to assign a direction to each edge in such a way that the resulting graph is egg-free, print a single line containing the string "No solution" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print a single line containing a string with length MM. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should be '^' if you want to direct the ii-th edge from uiui to vivi, or 'v' if you want to direct it from vivi to uiui.
