This is an interactive problem.
You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). Each vertex has a value; let's denote the value of vertex ii by aiai. Vertex vv is a bad adjacent of vertex uu if there is an edge between vertices uu and vv and avav is strictly greater than auau.
Your task is to find a vertex without any bad adjacent or determine that there is no such vertex. You do not know the values a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN, but you may ask up to 2020 questions.
In each question, you should choose a vertex xx; the grader responds with the number of some bad adjacent vertex of vertex xx or with −1−1 if xx does not have any bad adjacent.
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer — the number of test cases TT. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.
For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer NN.
Then, you should read N−1N−1 lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.
Then, you may ask questions.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 11 and xx (1≤x≤N1≤x≤N).
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer yy.
If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, y=−2y=−2. If xx has no bad adjacent, y=−1y=−1. Otherwise, yy is the number of a bad adjacent of xx.
When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 22 and xx. If there is no vertex without a bad adjacent, xx should be −1−1; otherwise, xx should be the number of a vertex without a bad adjacent.
Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 11 if your answer is correct or −2−2 if it is incorrect. If your answer is correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive −2−2 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Example case 1: The values of vertices in the tree are a1=3a1=3, a2=10a2=10, a3=20a3=20. Note that the answer to the first query could have been 33 instead of 22 as well.
Example case 2: The values of vertices in the tree are a1=4a1=4, a2=9a2=9, a3=3a3=3 and a4=3a4=3.
