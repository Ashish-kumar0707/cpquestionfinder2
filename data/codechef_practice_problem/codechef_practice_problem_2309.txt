You are given a sequence of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. A pair (x,y)(x,y), where 1≤x<y≤N1≤x<y≤N, is an inversion if Ax>AyAx>Ay.
You should answer QQ queries (numbered 11 through QQ). For each valid ii, in the ii-th query:

You are given a non-negative integer KiKi.
Consider a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, where Bj=Aj⊕KBj=Aj⊕K for each valid jj.
You should find the number of inversions in the sequence BB.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
each of the next QQ lines describes a query with a single integer KiKi.

Output
For each test case, print QQ lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer ― the answer to the ii-th query.
