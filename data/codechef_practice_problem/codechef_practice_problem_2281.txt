Chef has NN vases in a row (numbered 11 through NN, initially from left to right). He wants to sort them in a particular order which he finds the most beautiful. You are given a permutation p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN of the integers 11 through NN; for each valid ii, Chef wants the ii-th vase to end up as the pipi-th vase from the left.
In order to achieve this, Chef can swap vases. Any two vases can be swapped in 11 minute. Chef also has a very efficient, but limited, robot at his disposal. You are given MM pairs (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),…,(XM,YM)(X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),…,(XM,YM). For each valid ii, the robot can instantly swap two vases whenever one of them is at the position XiXi and the other at the position YiYi. Note that the initial positions of the vases are irrelevant to the robot.
Formally, Chef, at any moment, may choose to perform one of the following actions, until the vases are sorted in the desired order:

Choose two indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N) and swap the vases that are currently at the positions ii and jj. It takes 11 minute to perform this action.
Choose an integer kk (1≤k≤M1≤k≤M) and order the robot to swap the vases that are currently at the positions XkXk and YkYk. It takes 00 minutes to perform this action.

Chef cannot perform multiple operations at the same time ― if he chooses to perform some operation of the first type, he has to wait for 11 minute before performing any further operations.
What is the minimum number of minutes that Chef needs to sort the vases?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of minutes Chef needs to sort the vases.

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef can ask the robot to swap the vases at the positions 22 and 33, and then he can swap the vases at the positions 11 and 22.
Example case 2: The robot can swap each pair of vases, so the answer is 00.
Example case 3: Chef can swap the vases at the positions 11 and 44, then ask the robot to swap the vases at the positions 11 and 22, and then swap the vases at the positions 33 and 44, taking a total of two minutes.
