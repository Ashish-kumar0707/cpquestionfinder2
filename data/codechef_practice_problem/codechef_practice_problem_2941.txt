Ada is one of the best hairdressers in ChefLand. She invented a very cool hair style and named it "power tree".
A power tree with degree ll — let's denote it by PT(l)PT(l) — is a directed graph, which can be constructed recursively as follows:

PT(0)PT(0) consists of a single node.
For l>0l>0:
Create one node uu — the root of power tree PT(l)PT(l).
Construct all power trees with smaller degrees, i.e. PT(0),PT(1),…,PT(l−1)PT(0),PT(1),…,PT(l−1).
For each of the tree created in the previous step, add a directed edge from uu to its root.

Today, Ada is going to cut the hair of some customers. Of course, all of them want to have a power tree hair style!
A customer's uncut hair is represented by a directed graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and exactly one edge between each pair of vertices. Ada should remove some edges (possibly none) from this graph in such a way that the resulting graph is a power tree. Note that she is not allowed to remove vertices!
Can you help Ada find the edges she should remove?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next (N2)(N2) lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv describing a directed edge from vertex uu to vertex vv. The edges are numbered 11 through (N2)(N2) in this order.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to create a power tree, print a single line containing one integer −1−1.
Otherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer ee denoting the number of edges to remove. The second line should contain ee space-separated integers denoting the numbers of the edges to remove.

If there are multiple answers, you may print any one.

Explanation
Example case 1: Ada should remove edges (1,4)(1,4), (2,4)(2,4) and (3,1)(3,1). The resulting graph is a power tree with degree l=2l=2.
