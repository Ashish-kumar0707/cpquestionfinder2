Chef is playing a game called "Snake and Apple Tree". This game is played on a grid with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM). Some cells of this grid are blocked. Initially, there are also SS snakes present in SS non-blocked cells. The snakes do not grow, so each snake always takes up exactly one cell.
The game starts at second 00 and will run for TT seconds. At the end of each second, each snake may (independently from the other snakes) move to an edge-adjacent non-blocked cell or stay in its current cell. During each second, there may be at most one snake in each cell, but when a snake is moving out of a cell, another snake is allowed to move into that cell at the same time.
During these TT seconds, ZZ apple trees (numbered 11 through ZZ) will grow in some cells, bear fruit and wither. For each valid ii, the ii-th tree will grow in the cell in row XiXi and column YiYi and start bearing fruit at a time PiPi. At a later time QiQi, the tree will wither and bear no fruit. At each second between the PiPi-th and QiQi-th second (including PiPi, but not including QiQi), if there is a snake in the same cell as this tree and it does not move to another cell at the end of this second, it may eat an apple from this tree. Eating one apple from the tree increases the total happiness of the snakes by HiHi; if a snake eats multiple apples from this tree, the happiness increases by HiHi multiple times.
Each snake takes 11 second to eat an apple. It cannot do anything else while eating and if there are multiple trees bearing fruit in the same cell, a snake in that cell may only eat an apple from one tree during each second (possibly from different trees during different seconds).
Initially, the total happiness of the snakes is 00. Help Chef maximise their happiness after TT seconds.
Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers NN, MM, ZZ and TT.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains a single string with length MM describing the ii-th row of the grid: for each valid jj, the jj-th character of this string is '#' if the cell in the jj-th column of this row is blocked, '.' if it is empty or 'S' if it contains a snake.
ZZ lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤Z1≤i≤Z), the ii-th of these lines contains five space-separated integers XiXi, YiYi, PiPi, QiQi and HiHi.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum total happiness of the snakes.

3 1 0 20 4

Example Output 1
56

Explanation 1
There is only one snake. It starts in the cell (3,3)(3,3) and it will reach the only tree at (3,1)(3,1) during the 66-th second. From then on, it will eat apples from this tree until the 2020-th second, so the total happiness is (20−6)⋅4=56(20−6)⋅4=56.
Example Input 2

1 3 0 4 20
1 4 0 4 10

Example Output 2
60

Explanation 2
During the first two seconds, both snakes will move simultaneously to the right. Then, they will simultaneously start eating apples. Each snake will eat two apples, so the total happiness will be 2⋅(10+20)=602⋅(10+20)=60.
