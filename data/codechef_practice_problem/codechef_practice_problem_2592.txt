In your house, you have a lot of integers. These integers are coloured by QQ colours (numbered 11 through QQ). For each valid ii, you have bibi integers with colour ii and each of these integers has value aiai.
For each integer ii such that 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N, you need to find the number of different partitions of ii. Here, a partition of ii consists of one or more integers from your house such that the sum of values of these integers is equal to ii. Two partitions are different if there is a colour such that the number of integers with this colour in one partition is different from the number of integers with this colour in the other partition. Since these numbers could be very big, compute them modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
QQ lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contain two space-separated integers aiai and bibi.

Output
Print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of partitions of ii, modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
