Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.
You are given NN distinct points (P1,x,P1,y),(P2,x,P2,y),…,(PN,x,PN,y)(P1,x,P1,y),(P2,x,P2,y),…,(PN,x,PN,y) on the coordinate plane, and QQ queries in the form L R X.
In each query, consider the polygon formed by the points in the interval [L,R][L,R] (i.e. the points (PL,x,PL,y),(PL+1,x,PL+1,y),…,(PR,x,PR,y)(PL,x,PL,y),(PL+1,x,PL+1,y),…,(PR,x,PR,y)), along with (0,0)(0,0) and (X,0)(X,0).

If this polygon is not convex, that is the polygon contains an angle greater than 180∘180∘, output −1−1.
Otherwise, the polygon can be dissected into R−L+1R−L+1 triangles that all contain (X,0)(X,0) as a vertex. Out of these triangles, consider the triangle with the maximum area, and let this area be AA. Output 2A2A.

Input Format

The first line contains one integer NN - the number of points.
The ii-th line of the next NN lines contain two integers Pi,xPi,x and Pi,yPi,y - the xx and yy coordinate of the ii-th point.
The next line contains one integer QQ - the number of queries.
Each of the next QQ lines contain three integers LL, RR, and XX representing a query.

Output Format
For each query, output on a single line −1−1 if the polygon is not convex, otherwise output 2A2A, where AA is the area of the largest triangle the polygon can be dissected into per the statement's description.

Explanation

Query 11:


In the diagram above, note how the polygon can be dissected into 22 triangles that both include vertex (X,0)(X,0). The purple triangle has an area of 33 and the blue triangle has an area of 44.
Therefore, 2A=2×4=82A=2×4=8.
