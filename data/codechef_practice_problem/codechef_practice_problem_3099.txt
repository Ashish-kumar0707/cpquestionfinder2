You are given a string SS containing only decimal digits ('0' through '9') and a number NN. Your task is to insert an arbitrary number (including zero) of plus signs '+' into SS in order to form a valid expression whose value is equal to NN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string SS, followed by a space and an integer NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string — your solution, i.e. the expression obtained after inserting some plus signs into SS. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.
Constraints

T≤5T≤5
1≤|S|≤1201≤|S|≤120
N<=int(S)N<=int(S). Notes: int(S)int(S) is the integer value of SS, if we consider SS as an integer.

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): N<106N<106
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints
Example Input
4
15112 28
120012 33
123 123
15489001 10549

Example Output
15+11+2
1+20+012
123
1548+9001

Explanation
Example case 1: SS is "15112" and N=28N=28. We can put a plus sign before the third character and another plus sign before the last character of this string to form the expression 15+11+215+11+2, which is equal to 2828.
