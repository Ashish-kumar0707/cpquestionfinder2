Consider any two sets of integers strictly larger than 11, denoted by PP and QQ. The set PP is said to be divisible by QQ if each integer in PP is divisible by at least one (not necessarily the same for each of them) integer in QQ.
You are given a set A={A1,A2,…,AN}A={A1,A2,…,AN}, where Ai≤CAi≤C for each valid ii (note that CC does not necessarily equal max(A)max(A)). Find any set B={B1,B2,…,BM}B={B1,B2,…,BM} such that:

AA is divisible by BB
2≤Bi≤C2≤Bi≤C for each valid ii
MM is the smallest positive integer such that there is at least one set satisfying the previous two conditions

If there are multiple answers, you may find any one of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and CC.
The second line contains NN distinct space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer MM. The second line should contain MM space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM satisfying the given conditions.
