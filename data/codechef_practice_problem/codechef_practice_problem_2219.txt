Salmon runs a fish delivery company in Fish City. Fish City has NN vertical roads numbered 1,2,...,N1,2,...,N from left to right, each spaced 1 unit apart; similarly, there are MM horizontal roads numbered 1,2,...,M1,2,...,M from bottom to top, each spaced 1 unit apart. We will denote the intersection between the xx-th vertical road and the yy-th horizontal road as (x,y)(x,y). 
Salmon has to make KK deliveries, with the ii-th delivery starting at (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and ending at (x′i,y′i)(xi′,yi′). He can also travel every road with speed 0.50.5 (meaning it would take him 22 units of time to travel 11 unit of distance). However, Salmon can bribe the mayor of Fish City and make the mayor change exactly one horizontal road to a highway, meaning the speed on that road would increase to 11.
He wants to choose a road to be a highway such that the sum of durations of all the deliveries is minimum possible. Help him find this minimum sum!
Note that each delivery starts exactly at (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and ends at (x′i,y′i)(xi′,yi′), i.e., we don't count the time taken to travel from (x′i−1,y′i−1)(xi−1′,yi−1′) to (xi,yi)(xi,yi) in our answer.
Input:
The first line contains 3 integers, NN, MM and KK (1≤N,M,K≤1051≤N,M,K≤105).
The next KK lines describe deliveries. Each line contains 4 space-separated integers xixi, yiyi, x′ixi′, y′iyi′ (1≤xi,x′i≤N1≤xi,xi′≤N, 1≤yi,y′i≤M1≤yi,yi′≤M), describing the ii-th delivery.
Output:
Print one integer -- the minimum sum of durations possible.

Sample Input 1:
5 4 3
2 3 4 1
1 4 5 2
3 3 5 3

Sample Output 1:
16

Explanation:

Salmon can turn the 3rd horizontal road into a highway.

For the first delivery, we can go 2 units to the right taking 2 units of time, and 2 units down taking 4 units of time. The time taken is 2+4=62+4=6.
For the second delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 4 units right taking 4 units of time, and 1 unit down taking 2 units of time. The time taken is 2+4+2=82+4+2=8.
For the third delivery, we can go 2 units right taking 2 units of time.

Therefore, the total time taken is 6+8+2=166+8+2=16.
Sample Input 2:
10 2 3
1 2 10 2
2 1 9 1
4 1 7 1

Sample Output 2:
23

Explanation:

Salmon can turn the 1st horizontal road into a highway.

For the first delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 9 units right taking 9 units of time, and 1 unit up taking 2 units of time. The time taken is 2+9+2=132+9+2=13.
For the second delivery, we can go 7 units right taking 7 units of time.
For the third delivery, we can go 3 units to the right taking 3 units of time.

Therefore, the total time taken is 13+7+3=2313+7+3=23.
