Chef is collecting special ingredients in a cave. The cave has NN chambers and N−1N−1 passageways forming a tree. In other words, it is possible to move from one chamber to any other chamber using the passageways. Each passageway is of equal length and can be traversed in both directions.
At 00-th second, Chef is at chamber AjAj. At the start of each second, he can choose to either stay in the current chamber or move along a passageway to another chamber in 11 second. To collect more ingredients, he wants to visit as many distinct chambers as possible before leaving the cave at chamber BjBj.
There is a ghost that copies Chef's movement with a delay of KjKj seconds. This means that:

Before KjKj-th second, the ghost is not in the cave yet.
At KjKj-th second, the ghost appears in chamber AjAj.
At tt-th second (t≥Kjt≥Kj), the ghost will be in the same place that Chef was at (t−Kj)(t−Kj)-th second.

The ghost will capture the Chef if, at some moment of time, both of them are in the same chamber or using the same passageway, including the moment when Chef is about to leave at chamber BjBj.
For a given start chamber AjAj, end chamber BjBj and ghost movement delay KjKj, help Chef determine the maximum number of distinct chambers he can visit. You have to answer QQ such queries for the same cave.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ, representing the number of chambers and queries respectively.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers UiUi and ViVi, representing the two endpoints of a passageway.
Each of the next qq lines contains three space-separated integers AjAj, BjBj and KjKj, representing the start chamber, end chamber and ghost's movement delay for a query respectively.

Output Format
For each query, output on a single line the maximum number of distinct chambers that Chef can visit.

Explanation
The graph in the sample test case looks like this:

For the first query, the following table describes one way to move to visit 88 chambers. Notice that Chef can choose to stay in a chamber. It can be shown that there is no way to visit more than 88 chambers.
