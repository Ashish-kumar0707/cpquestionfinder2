You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN).
A simple path between two different vertices aa and bb (a<ba<b) is called a clamp path if it does not contain any vertices with numbers smaller then aa or greater than bb.
Calculate the number of clamp paths in the given tree.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN. For each valid ii, if pi≠0pi≠0, then there is an edge between vertices ii and pipi.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of clamp paths.
Constraints

2≤N≤2202≤N≤220
0≤pi≤N0≤pi≤N for each valid ii
there is exactly one vertex ii with pi=0pi=0
the graph described on the input is a tree

Example Input
7
0 5 5 1 4 1 4

Example Output
10

Explanation
The clamp paths are 1 - 4, 1 - 5, 1 - 6, 1 - 7, 2 - 5, 2 - 7, 3 - 5, 3 - 7, 4 - 5 and 4 - 7.
