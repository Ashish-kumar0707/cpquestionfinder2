There is a communication channel with N+1N+1 stations (numbered 00 through NN). Station 00 wants to send a message to station NN. You may install memory disks at up to KK of the stations 1,2,…,N−11,2,…,N−1. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by (v1,v2,…,vk)(v1,v2,…,vk), where k≤Kk≤K is the number of such stations, and let v0=0v0=0 and vk+1=Nvk+1=N. In stations other than v0,v1,…,vk+1v0,v1,…,vk+1, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.
For each ii (0≤i<N0≤i<N), if the message is currently at the station ii, this station can send the message to the station i+1i+1. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability pipi, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station i+1i+1. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station vjvj, where jj is the unique index such that vj≤i<vj+1vj≤i<vj+1 (if i=vji=vj, the message simply stays in the station vjvj), and this station has to send it forward again.
Your task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station NN is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.
You are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence F0,F1,…,FNF0,F1,…,FN. For each valid ii, pi=Fi+1/Fipi=Fi+1/Fi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains N+1N+1 space-separated integers F0,F1,…,FNF0,F1,…,FN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the smallest possible expected time needed for the message to reach station NN. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6.

Explanation
Example case 1: The probabilities of success are p0=p1=1/2p0=p1=1/2. If no memory disks are installed, the expected amount of time the message needs to reach station 22 is 66 seconds.
If a memory disk is installed at station 11, the expected time is 44 seconds (22 seconds to transfer from station 00 to station 11 and further 22 seconds to transfer from station 11 to station 22).
