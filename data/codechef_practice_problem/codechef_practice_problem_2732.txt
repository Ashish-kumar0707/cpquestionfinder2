Consider NN families (numbered 00 through N−1N−1). Each year, each family gives gifts to all other families based on the gifts they received in the previous year. Let's say that in some year, family ii received gifts with value aiai (from all families in total). Then, for each valid jj, the value of the gifts given by family ii to family jj in the next year is G(i,j)⋅aiG(i,j)⋅ai, where G(i,j)=2⋅(i∨j)−(i+j)G(i,j)=2⋅(i∨j)−(i+j); note that ∨∨ denotes bitwise OR.
For each valid ii, you are given the total value of gifts received by family ii in the year 00. Find the total values of gifts received by each family in the year KK. Since these values can be very large, compute them modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a0,a1,…,aN−1a0,a1,…,aN−1. For each valid ii, aiai denotes the total value of gifts received by family ii in the year 00.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN integers. For each ii (0≤i<N0≤i<N), the i+1i+1-th of these integers should be the total value of gifts received by family ii in the year KK, modulo 109+7109+7.
