There are NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN on a circle. For each valid ii, AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1 are adjacent; A1A1 and ANAN are also adjacent.
Chef has a sequence of integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, which he may use to perform any number of operations (including zero). In one operation, he should do the following:

Choose an integer ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N).
Choose ii consecutive integers on the circle.
Choose a sign S=±1S=±1 and add S⋅BiS⋅Bi to each of the chosen integers. In other words, either add BiBi to each of them or subtract BiBi from each of them.

The goal is to make all the integers on the circle equal to 00. Can Chef achieve it using these operations?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make all integers on the circle equal to 00 or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤N≤1031≤N≤103
0≤Ai,Bi≤1040≤Ai,Bi≤104 for each valid ii
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104

Explanation
Example case 1: We can make everything 00 using two operations: choose i=4i=4 and change the circular sequence (1,1,3,3,2)(1,1,3,3,2) to (1−1,1−1,3−1,3−1,2)=(0,0,2,2,2)(1−1,1−1,3−1,3−1,2)=(0,0,2,2,2), then choose i=3i=3 and change it to (0,0,2−2,2−2,2−2)=(0,0,0,0,0)(0,0,2−2,2−2,2−2)=(0,0,0,0,0).
Example case 2: The parities of integers on the circle cannot change, so they cannot become 00.
