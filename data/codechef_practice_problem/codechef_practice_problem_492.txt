It is JJ's birthday and you decide to gift him a string SS (consisting of English alphabet only) of length NN. But you also know that JJ does not like palindromes so you decide that none of the substrings of SS of length ≥2 should be a palindrome.
Can you find any suitable string which can be gifted to JJ?
Recall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. noon and level are palindromic strings.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the string S to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output a string S of length N such that none of its substrings (of length ≥2) is a palindrome.
If there are multiple strings which satisfy the condition, print any.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3
2

4



                        Sample Output 1
                        





gl
hf
waow


Explanation
Test case 1: gl is the only substring of length ≥2 and it is not a palindrome.
Test case 2: hf is the only substring of length ≥2 and it is not a palindrome. 
Test case 3: Following are the substrings of length ≥2:

Length=2: wa, ao, ow
Length=3: wao, aow
Length=4: waow

We can see that none of these substrings is a palindrome.
