Chef loves graphs. To express his love, he defines a function f(G,x,y)f(G,x,y) for an undirected connected graph GG with weighted edges and two of its vertices xx, yy. f(G,x,y)f(G,x,y) is defined as the minimum of weights of all paths in GG between the vertices xx and yy, where the weight of a path is the maximum of weights of edges in this path.
Chef has two connected graphs G1G1 and G2G2. Each of these graphs has NN vertices (labelled 11 through NN) and MM edges. Calculate S=∑i=1N−1∑j=i+1Nf(G1,i,j)⋅f(G2,i,j)S=∑i=1N−1∑j=i+1Nf(G1,i,j)⋅f(G2,i,j) modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
MM lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww denoting that vertices uu and vv in G1G1 are connected by an edge with weight ww.
MM more lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww denoting that vertices uu and vv in G2G2 are connected by an edge with weight ww.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum SS modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
