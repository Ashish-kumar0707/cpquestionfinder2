You are given a binary string SS of length NN. 
Let GG be a complete directed graph of NN vertices numbered from 11 to NN. There is a directed edge going from vertex uu to vv if one of the following is true:

Su=SvSu=Sv and u<vu<v
Su≠SvSu≠Sv and u>vu>v

For example, if S=1010S=1010 then GG looks like this:


You will be given QQ queries of two different types:

11 LL RR - Flip all the bits in SS in range [L,R][L,R] and update GG accordingly.
22 LL RR XX - Find whether there is a path that starts from vertex XX and visits each vertex in G[L,R]G[L,R] exactly once (a hamiltonian path in other words).

G[L,R]G[L,R] is the subgraph induced by the vertices in the range [L,R][L,R] and the edges connecting them. For example, if S=1010S=1010 then G[2,4]G[2,4] consists of the vertices 22, 33, and 44, and the three edges 2→42→4, 4→34→3, and 3→23→2.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers, NN and QQ.
The second line contains a binary string SS of length NN.
The ithith line of the next QQ lines contains the description of the ithith query.

Output Format
For each query of type 22, print a single line containing YES if there's a hamiltonian path starting from vertex XX, or NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation
Here's what GG initially looks like:



First query: 3→1→2→4→53→1→2→4→5 is a possible hamiltonian path.
Second query: There's no hamiltonian path that visits the vertices 33, 44, and 55 which starts from 33.
Third query: 4→5→34→5→3 is a possible hamiltonian path.
Fourth query: Flip the bits in the range [4,5][4,5] so SS becomes equal to 1100011000.
Fifth query: There's no hamiltonian path that visits the vertices 11, 22, 33, 44, and 55 which starts from 22.
Sixth query: Flip the bits in the range [2,3][2,3] so SS becomes equal to 1010010100.
Seventh query: 4→5→34→5→3 is a possible hamiltonian path.
