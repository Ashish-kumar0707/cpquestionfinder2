“You can make a lot by playing such games.”
Every player has to play a game of Ddakji with the recruiter in order to enter the squid game. Gi-Hun has played many rounds but was unable to win even once. The recruiter thus decided to give him a puzzle instead.
Gi-Hun is given an array AA of NN elements.
He can perform the following operation on array AA any number of times:

Select any two indexes 1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N such that i≠ji≠j and replace AiAi with Ai−AjAi−Aj.

His task is to find the minimum possible value of |A1|+|A2|+…+|AN||A1|+|A2|+…+|AN| attainable by performing these operations several (possibly, 00) times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains NN, the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers — A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each testcase, print on a new line one integer — minimum possible value of |A1|+|A2|+…+|AN||A1|+|A2|+…+|AN|.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109−109≤Ai≤109
Sum of NN across all test cases doesn't exceed 106106

Explanation
Test Case 1: Perform the operation with i=1i=1 and j=2j=2 four times. The array is now [0,1][0,1], and its value is |0|+|1|=1|0|+|1|=1.
Test Case 2: No operations need to be performed.
Test Case 4: Perform the following operations:

Choose i=4,j=2i=4,j=2 and set A4=6−2=4A4=6−2=4. The array is now [0,2,−2,4][0,2,−2,4].
Choose i=4,j=2i=4,j=2 and set A4=4−2=2A4=4−2=2. The array is now [0,2,−2,2][0,2,−2,2].
Choose i=2,j=4i=2,j=4 and set A2=2−2=0A2=2−2=0. The array is now [0,0,−2,2][0,0,−2,2].

The value of the array is now |0|+|0|+|−2|+|2|=4|0|+|0|+|−2|+|2|=4, and it can be proved that this is the minimum possible value.
