You are given a small graph GsGs with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges.
Let's create a big graph GbGb with NKNK nodes (numbered 11 through NKNK) and MKMK edges. GbGb consists of KK copies of GsGs ― formally, for each kk (0≤k≤K−10≤k≤K−1) and each edge between nodes uu and vv in GsGs, there is an edge between nodes u+kNu+kN and v+kNv+kN in GbGb.
Afterwards, let's take the complement of GbGb and call it HH ― formally, HH is a graph with NKNK nodes (numbered 11 through NKNK) such that for each pair of nodes, there is an edge between these two nodes in HH if and only if there is no edge between these two nodes in GbGb.
Count the number of spanning trees in HH. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers aa and bb denoting that the nodes aa and bb in GsGs are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of spanning trees in HH modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: HH is the complete graph on three nodes, so the number of spanning trees is 33 (any two of the edges form a spanning tree).
