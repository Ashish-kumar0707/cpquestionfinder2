You are given an array A consisting of N Integers which are initially all 0. You are also given an array B consisting of N Integers. You have to tell whether you can make A equal to B or not by performing the following operation any number of times.
In one operation you can choose exactly K distinct indices in the array A and increase the value at these indices by 1.
Input:

First line will contain T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines of input. 
First line contains two Integers N and K.
Second line contains N Integers denoting array B. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line YES if A can be converted to B, otherwise print NO.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤N
1≤B[i]≤109
Sum of N over all Testcases does not exceed 106.
