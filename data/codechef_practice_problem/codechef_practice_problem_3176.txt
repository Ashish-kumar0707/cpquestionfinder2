There are two people walking along a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN), each of them with speed 1 edge per second.
The walk of the first person is described by a sequence of nodes u1,u2,…,uKu1,u2,…,uK. This person appears in node u1u1 at time 00 and walks to node u2u2 using the shortest path; then, immediately after reaching u2u2, walks to node u3u3 using the shortest path, and so on, until reaching uKuK, when this person disappears.
The walk of the second person is described by another sequence v1,v2,…,vLv1,v2,…,vL in the same manner.
Count how many times these two people meet — in other words, how many times they reach the same node (including the first and last nodes of their walks) at the same time.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, KK and LL.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers pp and qq describing an edge between node pp and node qq.
The following line contains KK space-separated integers u1,u2,…,uKu1,u2,…,uK.
The last line contains LL space-separated integers v1,v2,…,vLv1,v2,…,vL.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of times the two people meet.
