Roger loves drawing polygons. For an arbitrary sequence of points in a 2D plane P0,P1,…,PM−1P0,P1,…,PM−1, he can draw a polygon with MM sides by connecting the points PiPi and P(i+1)%MP(i+1)%M with a straight line segment for each valid ii. As a result, any point forms a polygon with M=1M=1, any two distinct points also form a polygon with M=2M=2 and a polygon may have sides with length 00.
Roger calls a multiset SS of MM integers polygonable if there is a polygon created from a sequence with size MM (as defined above) such that the multiset of its side lengths is equal to SS. For example, the multisets (0,0)(0,0), (1,3,3)(1,3,3) or (9,9)(9,9) are all polygonable, but (4)(4) and (2,5,8)(2,5,8) are not.
Roger has a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN), where each edge is coloured in one of KK colours (numbered 11 through NN). He wants to pick an unordered pair of distinct vertices in the tree and create a multiset S=(S1,S2,…,SK)S=(S1,S2,…,SK), where SiSi is the number of edges on the path between the chosen vertices which have colour ii. Now, Roger is wondering: in how many ways can he pick a pair of vertices such that the resulting multiset SS is polygonable? Find the number of such pairs.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers vv, uu and cc, denoting an edge with colour cc between vertices vv and uu.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
