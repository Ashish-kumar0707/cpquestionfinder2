Ada has a set of NN non-negative integers S={x1,x2,…,xN}S={x1,x2,…,xN}. She defined the function WW as follows:

W({})=0W({})=0.
If S={a}S={a}, then W(S)=aW(S)=a.
If S={a,b}S={a,b} (so |S|=2|S|=2), then W(S)=(a⊕b)−1W(S)=(a⊕b)−1.
If |S|≥3|S|≥3, then to calculate W(S)W(S), find any two elements of SS that are congruent (have the same remainders) modulo the highest possible power of 22 (the highest power for which such a pair exists). Let's denote them by aa and bb. Then W(S)=W({a,b})⊕W(S∖{a,b})W(S)=W({a,b})⊕W(S∖{a,b}).
It is guaranteed that W(S)W(S) is well-defined, i.e. does not depend on the exact choice of the two congruent elements.

Here, ⊕⊕ represents the binary XOR operation and A∖BA∖B represents set difference.
Ada needs to calculate the function WW for each set that is created by removing exactly one element from SS. Formally, she wants to find W(S∖{xi})W(S∖{xi}) for each valid ii. Can you help her?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should denote W(S∖{xi})W(S∖{xi}).
