Chef has a sorted array AA of size NN consisting of distinctdistinct elements which you don’t know.don’t know. You will be provided with an integer XX. You have to check whether XX exists in Chef's array or not. If it exists, find out at which index it exists. 
You can ask just oneone type of query as follows ::-
You can ask at-most qq such queries.
If you ask a question for an index say mm, then Chef returns the sum of KK elements of his array starting from index mm, where K =K = 2i2i and ii is the maximum value of integerinteger such that mm is perfectly divisible by KK.
For Example, if  m=13m=13 then  KK is 11, if m=8m=8 then  KK is 88, if m=12m=12 then  KK is 44.
So, if say mm is 12, i.e. KK is 4, Chef will return sum of A[12] + A[13] + A[14] + A[15].

NOTENOTE - If you will ask for index greater than NN then Chef will return 00.
NOTENOTE - As for any query Chef will return sum of array elements from mm to m+K−1m+K−1. 
So if m+K−1m+K−1 gets larger than NN then Chef will return sum upto last element of the
array. For eg : For eg :  If size of array is 26 and KK for m = 16m = 16 is 1616, so m+K−1m+K−1 is 3131.
Chef will return sum of  A[16 : 26].

Interaction:

First, you should read a line containing a single integer TT denoting the number of 
test cases. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows-
For every test case, you have to read two space separated integers 
N and XN and X, for subtask 2, N is unknownsubtask 2, N is unknown so when N is -1N is -1
consider you don't know NN.
For each test case, you should start by asking questions as follows-

To ask a question, print a line containing two space separated integer 11 and mm.
Then, you must read a line containing a single integer.
When you think you know index of XX in  Chef's array,  print a line containing two
space separated integers 22 and index of XX.
If XX is not present in Chef's array,  print a line containing two
space separated integers 22 and −1−1.
Then, you must read a line containing a single string YesYes or NoNo. 
If this string is YesYes, you should  continue  solving  the  remaining  test  cases,
otherwise your answer was incorrect and 
you should immediately terminate your program to receive the Wrong AnswerWrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
