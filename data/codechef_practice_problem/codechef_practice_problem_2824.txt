A group of NN people (numbered 11 through NN) claimed that Chef is only good at cooking, but nothing else. Chef wanted to prove them wrong, so he accepted a challenge from them to guess their ages.
The NN people gave Chef MM pieces of information to help him. Each piece of information is described by four integers tt, uu, vv and cc with the following meaning:

If t=1t=1, the uu-th person is older than the vv-th person by at least cc years.
If t=2t=2, the uu-th person is not older than the vv-th person by at least cc years.

Chef also knows that all the ages are integers (strangely, not necessarily positive integers) and that the age of person 11 is zero.
Before Chef started thinking about the ages, he asked you to tell him whether it is even possible to determine the ages of all NN people uniquely using the information he has. Find out if it is possible and what the ages of these NN people are in that case.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
Each of the following MM lines contains four space-separated integers tt, uu, vv and cc describing one piece of information.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to uniquely determine the ages of all the people, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain a single string "YES" (without quotes).
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers denoting the ages of people 1,2,…,N1,2,…,N respectively.
