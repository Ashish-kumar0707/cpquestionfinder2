Problem description.
There are NN shops in a straight line some where in Mirzapur each of them selling same type of chocolate. 
Each shops have their own price of chocolate . Formally , ii-th shop sells A[i]A[i] number of chocolates in exchange of 11 coin . Also each shop will give B[i]B[i] number of chocolates for free to any customer that buys chocolates from their shop .

Chef likes chocolates very much so he regularly buys chocolates from any one shopkeeper who will give him maximum number of chocolates . 
Chef also likes playing with intervals . So each time Chef will have xx number of coins in his pocket and two integers LL and RR . Chef will look at every shop that lies between LL and RR and will buy chocolates from that shop which will give him maximum number of chocolates for xx coins .

Also the position of shops are changing with time . 
 
More formally there are QQ actions of two types that are happening in a sequence. 
11 ii jj ii-th shop is shifted after jj-th shop. 
22 LL RR xx                 Chef arrives at market to buy chocolates with xx coins in his pocket along with two integers LL and RR as described above.   
  Note that there are only 1010% queries of type 11 .

Input:

First line will contain NN, number of shops.
Next NN lines contains two space separated integers A[i]A[i] and B[i]B[i] as described above
Next line contain one integer QQ number of queries. 
Next QQ line will contain queries of either of two types : 1)1) 11 ii jj   ,     2)2) 22 LL RR xx 


Output:
Print the answer for each query of type two in a new line.

EXPLANATION:
Before shifting shops in range [2,3][2,3] are (4,5)and(1,3)(4,5)and(1,3) out of which 11-st shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. 4∗3+5=174∗3+5=17. 
After shifting sequence of shop will be as below : 
2 2  
1 3
3 6
4 5
7 1
 Therefore  shops in range [2,3][2,3] are (1,3)and(3,6)(1,3)and(3,6) out of which 22-nd shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. 3∗3+6=153∗3+6=15.
