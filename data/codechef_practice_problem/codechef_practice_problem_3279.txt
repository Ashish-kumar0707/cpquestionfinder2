So they decided on another option for the toss, before the match both the teams will be given a Competitive Programming Problem. The first team who solves the problem will have the right to choose whether to bat or field. In today's match following problem is given:- 


You are given a rectangular sheet of side lengths NN and MM. You are also given a variable TT, which is initially 00.


You perform the following operation on rectangle:-



 If N=1N=1 and M=1M=1, process ends.
 Otherwise you will randomly cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically parallel to the side of the rectangle. You can only cut from integer coordinates and all the available options for cuts are equally probable. Increment TT by 11 and continue the process with the rectangle of larger area.

You have to report the E(T2)E(T2), the expected value of T2T2.


It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute PP⋅⋅Q−1Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q−1Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.



Help your favorite team in solving the problem.


 Input 

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of
        TT test cases follows.
     The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN, MM.


 Output 

 For each test case, print a single line containing one integer, PP⋅⋅Q−1Q−1  modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.


Constraints

 11 ≤≤ TT ≤≤ 105105 
 11 ≤≤ NN, MM ≤≤ 106106
