There is a game played on a one-dimensional axis. NN stones will appear on this axis. Each of these stones is described by three numbers xixi, titi, cici, meaning the stone will appear at a point xixi, at time titi, and has a value cici.
There are pp players initially (at time 00) all at the point 00. If a player is at a point xx at time tt, then at time t+1t+1, he/she can be either at xx or at x+1x+1. A player is able to pick up a stone with value cici if he/she is at the point xixi at the time titi. Picking up a stone does not take any time. Each stone can be picked up at most once.
The score of a player is defined as the sum of values of stones he/she has picked up. The score of a number of players is simply the sum of their individual scores. Devise a strategy for the players to gain the maximum total score.
You should find the maximum possible total score for each number of players pp between 11 and KK inclusive.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers xixi, titi and cici.

Output Format
For each test case, print KK lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer - the maximum total score for ii players.
