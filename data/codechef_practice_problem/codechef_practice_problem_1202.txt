You are given an array A of size N. Initially, the array is filled with 0-s.
There are M types of operations that you can perform on array A. The i^{th} operation can be described by two integers (x_i, y_i). In this operation, you choose a set of indices S such that 

1 \leq j \leq N,
(j \bmod y_i) \neq 0,
A_j = 0, 

, then you set A_j = x_i for all j \in S.
You can perform the operations in any order, but one type of operation can't be done more than once. What is the maximum sum of integers of the array A you obtain if you perform the M operations optimally?
For example, consider the array A = [0, 0, 0, 0].

Suppose x = 3, y = 2. Here you can choose indices 1 and 3 and set A_1 = A_3 = 3. So the array A becomes [3, 0, 3, 0]. In this operation you can't choose the indices 2 and 4 because (2 \bmod 2) = 0, (4 \bmod 2) = 0. 
Suppose x = 5, y = 3 and you set A_2 = 5. So the array A becomes [3, 5, 3, 0]. Here you can't choose index 1 because A_1 \gt 0 and index 3 because (3 \bmod 3) = 0 and A_3 \gt 0. However, you could also set A_4 = 5.
Suppose x = 4, y = 4. Now you can't choose any index because A_j \gt 0  for all 1 \leq j \leq 3 and (4 \bmod 4) = 0. So the array remains same.

Note: Since input-output is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase contains M + 1 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i^{th} of these lines contains two space-separated integers x_i, y_i - parameters of the i^{th} operation.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum sum of integers of the array A after M operations.
Constraints

1 \leq T \leq 12600
1 \leq N \leq 10^9
1 \leq M \leq 10^5
1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9
2 \leq y_i \leq 10^9
The sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
