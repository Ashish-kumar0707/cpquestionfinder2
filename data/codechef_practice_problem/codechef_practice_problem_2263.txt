The structure of the company ShareChat can be described by a simple graph (without multiedges and self-loops) with NN vertices numbered 11 through NN and MM edges numbered 11 through MM. Each vertex of this graph is part of at most one simple cycle.
For each edge, you should find the number of simple paths that contain this edge and only contain at most one edge which belongs to a cycle.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv, denoting the vertices connected by edge ii.

Output
For each test case, print MM lines. For each ii (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M), the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the number of paths for edge ii.
