Being a newcomer to Computopia, Chef is confused by the countless subway lines in the city. Help him!
You are given an undirected graph with NN vertices and MM edges. There are no self-loops and no simple cycles that contain more than 2 edges in the graph (i.e. if we replaced each set of multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices by one edge, we would obtain a tree). Each edge also has a colour.
Consider a simple path with length KK in the graph that passes through edges with colours A1,A2,…,AKA1,A2,…,AK in this order. The cost of this path is defined as (A1≠A2)+(A2≠A3)+⋯+(AK−1≠AK)(A1≠A2)+(A2≠A3)+⋯+(AK−1≠AK), where the boolean value true is interpreted as the integer 11 and false is interpreted as 00. In other words, the cost of a simple path is the number of pairs of neighbouring (consecutive) edges on this path with different colours. The cost of a path with length 00 is defined to be 00.
You need to answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given vertices uu and vv; you should find the maximum possible cost of some simple path connecting them.
Note that a simple path may not visit a vertex more than once.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
Each of the next MM lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv with colour ww.
The next line contains an integer QQ.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum cost of a simple path.
