Given a subset of digits S and a number N, find the smallest positive number which contains only the digits from S and is a multiple of N or -1 if solution does not exists.
Input:

First line contains integer tt, denoting the number of test cases
First line of each test case contains two integers, m,Nm,N, denoting size of set S and the number whose multiple you have to find.
Next Line of the test case consists of mm distinct space-separated integers denoting the digits in set SS.

Output:

For each test case, output single line with answer to the test case.

Constraints

1≤T≤301≤T≤30
1≤|S|≤101≤|S|≤10
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105

Sample Input:
2
3 123
2 4 6
3 101
0 3 2

Sample Output:
246
202

Explanation:
For first case, 246 is the smallest positive multiple of 123 that has only digits from set {2,4,6}
