As you know Chef likes problems which involving into newest data structures. Today he has troubes in solving tricky problem. You have array A consisting of N integers and Q queries to it. Queries are next:
- L R K, how many values in segment A[L..R] have frequency not more than K.
Input
The first line of input contains T - number of test cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, first line contains an integer N - number of elements in array, and integer Q - number of queries to it.
Second line contains N positive integer numbers - elements of array A. Each of next Q lines containing three integers L, R, K.
Output
For each query output answer for it in separate line.
Constraints

1 ≤ T, N, Q, sum over all values of N in the input, sum over all values of Q in the input ≤ 200,000
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
1 ≤ K ≤ N
