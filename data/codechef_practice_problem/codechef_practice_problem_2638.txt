Todd Alquist is being taught the process of cooking methamphetamine, but to see whether he's really capable of learning it, Walt gives him a problem to solve. Since he can't solve it, he asks you for help.
You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN), rooted at the vertex 11. There is an integer written at each vertex; for each valid ii, the value of vertex ii is AAii.There also exists a special integer KK. 
Choose any leaf node, denoted by XX, and go down a simple path from rootroot to XX.
Let SS denote the set of all nodes lying on the simple path from rootroot to XX.
For all ii ϵϵ SS, choose an integer DD ϵϵ [2A[i]−1,2A[i])[2A[i]−1,2A[i]).
Informally, for every node ii lying on the simple path from rootroot to XX, you have to choose an integer DD such that  2A[i]−1≤D<2A[i]2A[i]−1≤D<2A[i].  
You now have to perform one of the two following operations :   

Bitwise XOR of all chosen integers.  
Bitwise AND of all chosen integers.   

You have to determine whether you can choose the values in such a way that after performing one of the given operations you can get an integer equal to KK.  

Note : A leaf is a node of the tree without any child nodes.

Determine if it is possible to obtain the value KK by performing the given operations.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N,KN,K denoting the number of nodes and the value of the special integer .
N−1N−1 lines follow , each line contains two space separated integers u,vu,v denoting an edge between uu and vv. 
A single line follows containing NN space separated integers denoting the value of nodes.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "YES"(without quotes) or "NO"(without quotes).

Sample Output:
YES

EXPLANATION:
There are two leaf nodes, 5 and 6
considering path from root to 5
we have nodes
1->2->4->5
we can select the values
5,26,75,1 and perform operation 1 that is XOR of all numbers to get 85
