There are two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. Answer QQ queries on these sequences.
In each query, you should calculate the dot product of subsequences Ax,Ax+1,…,Ax+l−1Ax,Ax+1,…,Ax+l−1 and By,By+1,…,By+l−1By,By+1,…,By+l−1, i.e. the value of the expression
∑k=0l−1Ax+kBy+k.∑k=0l−1Ax+kBy+k.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
Each of the following QQ lines contains three space-separated integers xx, yy and ll describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query (the dot product).
