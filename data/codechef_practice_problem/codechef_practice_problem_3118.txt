Sonya is a very smart girl, so Danya wants to give her something interesting. He thought about it for a long time and decided that the best gift would be a tree. This tree has NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN); of course, it is a connected graph with N−1N−1 edges connecting those vertices.
Danya realised that an ordinary tree probably would not surprise Sonya. Therefore, he decided to place integers 00 through N−1N−1 into the tree in such a way that each vertex contains exactly one integer and each of these integers appears in exactly one vertex. For each valid ii, let's denote the integer placed in vertex ii by pipi.
The beauty of a tree is defined as the number of beautiful simple undirected paths in it. A path with length LL (containing LL vertices; possibly L=1L=1) is beautiful if for each ii (0≤i≤L−10≤i≤L−1), there is a vertex vv on this path such that pv=ipv=i.
Danya doubts that this is the most beautiful tree, so he wants to perform MM operations. In each operation, he selects two (not necessarily distinct) vertices uu and vv and swaps pupu with pvpv. After each operation, he would like to know the current beauty of the tree. Please help him compute it so that he can decide when the tree will be the best gift for Sonya.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN denoting the integers initially placed in the tree.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv.
The next line contains a single integer MM.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv describing one operation.

Output
For each operation, print a single line containing one integer -  the beauty of the tree after this operation.
