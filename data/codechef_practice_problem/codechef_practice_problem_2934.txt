    You are given a string SS and you want to make it (n,k)(n,k) special. String AA is (n,k)(n,k) 
    special if after concatenating nn copies of string AA we get at least kk substring 
    of AA in the resulting string (Overlapping substrings also count). Your task is to find the minimum number of characters you need to 
    alter to make string SS, (n,k)(n,k) special.


Note : Inputs are given such that it is always possible to get at least k substrings.



 Input 

The first line contains a single integer TT, which denotes the number 
        of test cases. The description of each test case follows. 
    
 The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk.
    

        The second line of each test case contains the string SS. 
    


 Output 
    For each test case, Output minimum number of characters you need to alter 
    to make string SS, (n,k)(n,k) special.
