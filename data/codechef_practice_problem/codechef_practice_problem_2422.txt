Chef is playing a tricky game with a sequence a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN. Initially, his score is S=1S=1. In the game, he performs the following process exactly KK times (note that the sequence aa never changes):

Pick an element XX from the sequence aa uniformly randomly.
Change the score SS to (S⋅X)%N(S⋅X)%N.

Find the expected value of Chef's score SS at the end of the game. It can be shown that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ, where PP and QQ are coprime integers, P≥0P≥0, Q>0Q>0 and QQ is coprime with 109+7109+7. You should compute P⋅Q−1%(109+7)P⋅Q−1%(109+7), where Q−1Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7109+7.
