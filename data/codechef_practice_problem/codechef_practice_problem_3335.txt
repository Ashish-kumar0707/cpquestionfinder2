Let a (x,y)(x,y) rectangle denote an axis-aligned rectangle with width equal to xx and height equal to yy, where xx and yy are positive integers.
You are given a (N,M)(N,M) rectangle. You must repeat the following process as long as your rectangle has at least one side longer than 11:

Make a horizontal or vertical cut inside the rectangle, splitting it into two rectangles. The sides of both these rectangles must still be positive integers.
If the cut is horizontal, discard the bottom rectangle, otherwise discard the right rectangle. The process continues with the remaining rectangle.

In the end, you are left with a (1,1)(1,1) rectangle --- a square with side length 11.
There may be several possible ways or paths to reduce a (N,M)(N,M) rectangle to a (1,1)(1,1) rectangle. Let's define the cost of a path as the sum of areas of all rectangles present in that path, including the (N,M)(N,M) and (1,1)(1,1) rectangle.
For example, let's consider a (2,2)(2,2) rectangle. There are two possible paths to reduce a (2,2)(2,2) rectangle to a (1,1)(1,1) rectangle:

(2,2)→(1,2)→(1,1)(2,2)→(1,2)→(1,1)
(2,2)→(2,1)→(1,1)(2,2)→(2,1)→(1,1)

The cost of the first path is 2⋅2+1⋅2+1⋅1=72⋅2+1⋅2+1⋅1=7, and similarly, the cost of the second path is 2⋅2+2⋅1+1⋅1=72⋅2+2⋅1+1⋅1=7.
You are also given a known prime number PP. Find the sum of costs of all possible paths modulo PP.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and PP.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the sum of costs of all paths modulo PP.
