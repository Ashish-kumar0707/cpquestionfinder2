Ashi had been given an array AA having NN element and you are asked QQ queries of 33 types.
11 XX :- If the array element at index XX is even, then move it to the beginning of the array, otherwise move it to the end of the array (if the element is moved to the beginning then all numbers behind the index XX will be shifted one position right to their initial positions and if it is moved to the end then all elements after the index XX will move one position left to their initial positions.)
For example, if the array is A=[1,2,3,4,5]A=[1,2,3,4,5] and after moving of 4th4th element to the beginning, the changed array will be A=[4,1,2,3,5]A=[4,1,2,3,5].
22 XX PP :- Change element of the array at index XX to PP
33 LL RR KK :- Find the count of numbers of the array AA from index LL to RR (including both LL and RR) having KK set bits.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ, the number of elements in the array AA, and the number of queries.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers of the array AA.
Next QQ lines contain two, there, or four space-separated integers according to the type of query, the first integer will represent the type of query.

Output

For each query of type 33 print the required number in a new line.

Explanation:

After 1st1st query: 11 22 1010 44 55 66 77
After 2nd2nd query: 66 11 22 1010 44 55 77
For 3rd3rd query : there are 22 numbers(66 and 1010) in the range 11 to 44 which have 22 set bits.
