Gru has been ordering the minions to do a lot of work lately. Minions don't want to trust Gru anymore. So, they propose a problem to Gru. They will only help Gru if he can answer the problem correctly. The minions  generate an endless string ss by following these steps:

Let ss be an empty string.
i=1i=1.
Append ii a s to the back of ss.
Append ii b s to the back of ss.
Multiply ii by 22 and go back to the third step.

So ss will be abaabbaaaabbbb…. Now let's define f(x)f(x) as number of distinct palindrome substring segments in s[1…x]s[1…x]. For example, f(3)=4f(3)=4 because a (which is s[1…1]s[1…1]), b (which is s[2…2]s[2…2]), a (which is s[3…3]s[3…3]) and aba (which is s[1…3]s[1…3]) are possible palindrome substrings of s[1…3]s[1…3].
The minions will give an integer NN. Help Gru calculate (∑Ni=1f(i))mod(109+7)∑i=1Nf(i))mod(109+7).
Note: We are using 1-indexing.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which has one integer, NN. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer modulo (109+7)(109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤1031≤T≤103
1≤N≤10181≤N≤1018

Sample Input:
1
3

Sample Output:
7

EXPLANATION:
f(1)=1f(1)=1, f(2)=2f(2)=2, f(3)=4f(3)=4. And so, the answer for N=3N=3 is 1+2+4=71+2+4=7.
