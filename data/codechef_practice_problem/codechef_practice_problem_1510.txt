Alice and Bob are playing a game on a binary string SS of length NN.
Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice going first. On their turn, the current player must choose any index 1≤i<|S|1≤i<|S| such that Si≠Si+1Si≠Si+1 and erase either SiSi or Si+1Si+1 from the string. This reduces the length of SS by one, and the remaining parts of SS are concatenated in the same order.
The player who is unable to make a move loses.
Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the length of the string.
The second line contains the binary string SS of length NN.

Output Format
For each test case output AliceAlice if Alice wins the game, otherwise output BobBob.
The output is not case-sensitive, so for example "Bob", "boB" and "Bob" are all considered equivalent.
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1052≤N≤105
SS is a binary string
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 11: There is no such index ii such that Si≠Si+1Si≠Si+1. So, Alice does not have any move and loses, making Bob the winner.
Test Case 22: Alice can choose i=2i=2 (because S2=1S2=1 and S3=0S3=0) and remove S3S3. After this move, the remaining string is "1111". Bob now has no moves and thus loses.
