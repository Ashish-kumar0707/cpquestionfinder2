A polygon TT is said to be inside a polygon SS if all points that lie strictly inside TT (not on the perimeter of TT) also lie strictly inside SS.
A multiset of polygons {Q1,Q2,…,Qr}{Q1,Q2,…,Qr} is said to form a chain if there is a permutation p1,p2,…,prp1,p2,…,pr of the integers 11 through rr such that for each ii (1≤i<r1≤i<r), QpiQpi is inside Qpi+1Qpi+1.
You are given NN convex polygons P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Every 10−10010−100 seconds, you may choose one of the polygons and translate it by upto 10−10010−100 either along the xx-axis or along the yy-axis.
Find the minimum amount of time necessary to make all NN polygons form a chain or decide that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN. The descriptions of NN polygons follow.
For each polygon:
The first line contains a single integer MM denoting the number of its vertices.
The following MM lines describe the vertices in counterclockwise order. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy denoting the coordinates of one vertex.

Output
If it is impossible to make the polygons form a chain, print a single line containing the integer −1−1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing one real number ― the minimum amount of time. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6.
Constraints

2≤N≤202≤N≤20
the sum of MM over all polygons does not exceed 100100
|x|,|y|≤100|x|,|y|≤100

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N=2N=2 and both polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #2 (20 points): N=2N=2
Subtask #3 (20 points): all polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #4 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: Both P1P1 and P2P2 are squares. If we move P2P2 by 11 unit in the xx-direction and by 22 units in the yy-direction, the vertices of P1P1 become the midpoints of edges of P2P2.
