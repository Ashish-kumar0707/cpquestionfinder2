Madoka was given a tree on her coming of age, and not a simple one, but a rooted tree of nn vertices with a root at the vertex with the number 11.
For all i≥2i≥2, let PiPi (1≤Pi≤i−11≤Pi≤i−1) be the parent of the vertex ii.
Let's define the depth array hh as follows: h1=1h1=1, and hi=hPi+1hi=hPi+1 for all i≥2i≥2.
The subtree of a vertex uu, denoted S(u)S(u), is defined as the set of vertices vv such that the unique path from 11 to vv contains uu. Also, we define valu=max{h(v):v∈S(u)}.valu=max{h(v):v∈S(u)}.
A tree is divided into paths by a ladder decomposition if each vertex is located on exactly one path, and each vertex uu with at least one child lies in the same path as its child vv with the maximum valvvalv, and if there are several such vertices, then the vertex with the minimum number is selected.
Madoka defines the beauty of a tree in the following way. Let the ladder decomposition of the path lengths be L1,…,LkL1,…,Lk, then the beauty of the tree is L21+L22+⋯+L2kL12+L22+⋯+Lk2
For each ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), your task is to calculate the beauty of the tree formed by the first ii vertices.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. Then TT test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn - the size of the tree.
The second line contains n−1n−1 integers P2,…,PnP2,…,Pn.

Output
For each test case, print in a separate line a single integer - the answer to the problem.
