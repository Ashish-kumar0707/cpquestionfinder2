It is the end of 2019 — the 17th of November, the Cooking Challenge day.
There are NN players participating in this competition, numbered 11 through NN. Initially, the skill level of each player is zero. There are also MM challenges (numbered 11 through MM). For each valid ii, the ii-th challenge has three parameters LiLi, RiRi and XiXi with the following meaning: for each player between the LiLi-th and RiRi-th inclusive, if this player participates in this challenge, their skill level increases by XiXi (XiXi does not have to be positive).
The organizers of the Cooking Challenge decided that the contest would be boring if they let the participants participate in the challenges directly, so they decided to use the compos.
There are QQ compos (numbered 11 through QQ). For each valid ii, the ii-th compo has two parameters AiAi and BiBi, which means that it includes the challenges Ai,Ai+1,…,BiAi,Ai+1,…,Bi.
Each participant has to select a subset of the compos (possibly empty or the set of all QQ compos) and participate in all challenges those compos include. A participant may not select the same compo twice, but may participate in the same challenge more than once if it is included in multiple chosen compos.
For each player, find the maximum skill level this player can reach if the compos are chosen optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and QQ.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers LiLi, RiRi and XiXi.
QQ more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers AiAi and BiBi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should denote the maximum skill level of the ii-th player.

Explanation
Example case 1:

The first player will select the 33-rd compo.
The second and third players will not select any compo.
The fourth player will select the 11-st, 22-nd and 44-th compos.
The fifth player will select all the compos.
