Chef calls a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN good if it satisfies the following conditions:

Ai⊕Ai+1>0Ai⊕Ai+1>0 for all valid ii
Ai−1⊕Ai⊕Ai+1=AiAi−1⊕Ai⊕Ai+1=Ai for all valid ii

In particular, any sequence with length 11 is good and any sequence of length 22 which satisfies the first condition is good.
Here, ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef gives you a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 00): choose 33 pairwise distinct valid indices aa, bb and cc and change AcAc to Aa⊕AbAa⊕Ab. Note that this means the operation can only be performed if N≥3N≥3.
Chef is asking you to make the sequence good using at most 3⋅N3⋅N operations or report that it is impossible. Note that you do not have to minimise the number of performed operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to change the given sequence into a good sequence using at most 3⋅N3⋅N operations, print a single line containing the integer −1−1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer MM (0≤M≤3⋅N0≤M≤3⋅N) ― the number of operations you want to perform.
Then, print MM lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each ii (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M), the ii-th of these lines should contain three space-separated integers aiai, bibi and cici (pairwise distinct; 1≤ai,bi,ci≤N1≤ai,bi,ci≤N) ― the indices on which the ii-th operation is performed.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence is already good, so performing 00 operations is a valid solution.
Example case 2: The sequence cannot be made good using at most 3⋅N3⋅N operations.
Example case 3: We can make the sequence good by performing the 44 operations shown on the output, in this order. Note that the initial sequence is also good, so performing 00 operations is also a valid solution. 
Example case 4: The sequence does not satisfy the first condition and since N=2N=2, we cannot perform any operations on it.
