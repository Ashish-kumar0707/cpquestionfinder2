Chef likes tournament graphs, which are directed graphs where each unordered pair of vertices is directly connected by exactly one edge. A directed graph is strongly connected if for each pair of vertices (a,b)(a,b), there is a path from the vertex aa to the vertex bb.
Consider a tournament graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). Chef takes a sequence of pairs of vertices (a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(aM,bM)(a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(aM,bM) and does the following for each ii from 11 to MM in this order:

Flip the direction of the edge between vertices aiai and bibi.
If the graph is strongly connected either before or after flipping this edge, declare GG a bad tournament.

If GG is never declared a bad tournament, Chef calls it a good tournament. Given the sequence of MM edge flips, find a good tournament.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aiai and bibi.

Output
For each test case, print N−1N−1 lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain N−iN−i space-separated integers; for each valid jj, the jj-th of these integers should be 11 if there is an edge from the vertex ii to the vertex i+ji+j or 00 if there is an edge from the vertex i+ji+j to the vertex ii.
It can be proved that a good tournament always exists under the given constraints. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them.
