A permutation is an array consisting of NN distinct integers from 11 to NN in arbitrary order.
Chef has two permutation arrays AA and PP of length NN. Chef performs the following three types of operations on the array AA:

11 : Permute the array AA according to the order defined by permutation PP.That is, replace AA with the array BB where B[P[i]]=A[i]B[P[i]]=A[i].
2 x y2 x y : Swap the elements at positions xx and yy in AA.
3 x3 x : Output the element at position xx in array AA. 

For each operation of type 33, Chef wants you to output the element at position xx in array AA after all preceding operations have been applied.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN integers denoting elements of array AA.
The third line contains NN integers denoting elements of array PP.
The fourth line contains a single integer QQ, denoting the number of operations to be performed.
QQ lines follow, each describing an operation of one of the three types above.

Output
For each test case, for each query of type 33, output the answer in a separate line.

Explanation
Initially, array AA is [1,2,3][1,2,3].
It changes as follows: [1,2,3][1,2,3] -> [3,1,2][3,1,2] -> [3,2,1][3,2,1].
So, we output element at position 11 in array AA, which is 33.
