Cyborg Jenish is angry.
He has so much rage that he decided to go on a demolition spree for QQ days.
There are NN cities in his world numbered 11 to NN, in a row from left to right. That is the ithith city from left side is city-ii where 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N. The supreme leader of the world is VSM and there are infinite statues of VSM in each city.
On each day Jenish chooses two cities LL and RR. He starts at city-LL and moves along the row towards right side till he reaches the city-RR. In city-LL he destroys 11 statue, in the next city (i.e. city-L+1L+1) he destroys 22 statues, and so on till city-RR where he destroys  R−L+1R−L+1 statues. In other words, he destroys i−L+1i−L+1 statues in the ithith city ( L≤i≤RL≤i≤R ).
Find the total number of VSM statues he destroyed in each city after QQ days.
Input:

The first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.  
The first line of each test case, contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ denoting the number of cities in his world and  the number of days he goes on a demolition spree respectively.  
The ithith line of next QQ lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR denoting the starting city and the ending city respectively on ithith day.

Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing NN space-separated integers.
The ithith integer should denote the total number of VSM statues destroyed by cyborg Jenish in the city-ii after QQ days.

Explanation
In the first test case, the cyborg does the following:

Starts at city-1 and goes till city-3, hence destroys 11 statue in city-1, 22 in city-2, and 33 in city-3.  
Starts at city-1 and goes till city-2, hence destroys 11 statue in city-1 and 22 in city-2.  
Starts at city-4 and goes till city-5, hence destroys 11 statue in city-4 and 22 in city-5.  
Hence he destroyed total 22 statues in city-1, 44 in city-2, 33 in city-3, 11 in city-4, and 22 in city-5.
