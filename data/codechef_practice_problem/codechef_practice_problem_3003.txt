You have an N×MN×M grid. The grid can be filled with the values 00 and 11 only. Initially, all the cells of the grid are filled with value 00.  
You start from the cell (1,1)(1,1). When you are at position (i,j)(i,j), you can do one of the following: 

Change A(i,j)A(i,j) to 11 and go to cell (i+1,j+1)(i+1,j+1).
Keep A(i,j)A(i,j) as 00 and go to cell (i+1,j)(i+1,j) or (i,j+1)(i,j+1). 

If, at some point, you are out of the grid, the process ends. 
Let SS denote the set of all distinct matrices that can be created using the method explained above.  
Let f(T)f(T) be the number of ways to place any (possibly zero) number of rooks in the grid TT such that both the following conditions are satisfied:

No two rooks attack each other.
No rook is placed in a cell (i,j)(i,j) such that T(i,j)=1T(i,j)=1. 

Find the value of ∑f(T)∑f(T) where T∈ST∈S. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 998244353998244353.
Note:

Two matrices AA and BB are different if there exists some cell (i,j)(i,j) such that A(i,j)≠B(i,j)A(i,j)≠B(i,j).
Two ways of arranging rooks is different if there exists a cell (i,j)(i,j) such that a rook is placed in the cell (i,j)(i,j) in one way and the cell (i,j)(i,j) is empty in the other way.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or the same column.

Input Format
The first and only line of input consists of two integers NN and MM, the dimensions of the grid.
Output Format
Print a single line containing one integer - the value of ∑f(T)∑f(T) where T∈ST∈S modulo 998244353998244353.

Explanation
We can create 33 distinct matrices:

[1,0][1,0] : Start from (1,1)(1,1) and change A(1,1)A(1,1) to 11. Thus, you move to cell (2,2)(2,2). This cell is out of the matrix. Therefore, the process ends.
[0,1][0,1]: Start from (1,1)(1,1) and keep A(1,1)A(1,1) as 00. Move to cell (1,2)(1,2). Change A(1,2)A(1,2) to 11. Thus, you move to cell (2,3)(2,3). This cell is out of the matrix. Therefore, the process ends.
[0,0][0,0]: This matrix is generated in three cases:
Start from (1,1)(1,1) and keep A(1,1)A(1,1) as 00. Move to cell (1,2)(1,2) and keep A(1,2)A(1,2) as 00. Move to cell (1,3)(1,3). This cell is out of the matrix. Therefore, the process ends.
Start from (1,1)(1,1) and keep A(1,1)A(1,1) as 00. Move to cell (1,2)(1,2) and keep A(1,2)A(1,2) as 00. Move to cell (2,2)(2,2). This cell is out of the matrix. Therefore, the process ends.
Start from (1,1)(1,1) and keep A(1,1)A(1,1) as 00. Move to cell (2,1)(2,1). This cell is out of the matrix. Therefore, the process ends.

Thus, S={[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]}S={[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]}. Calculating the number of ways to place rooks while satisfying both conditions:

T=[1,0]T=[1,0]: There are 22 ways to place rooks:
Place 00 rooks in the matrix.
Place 11 rook in the cell (1,2)(1,2). Since there is only one rook, no two rooks attack each other. Also, the cell in which the rook is placed has value 00. 
T=[0,1]T=[0,1]: There are 22 ways to place rooks:
Place 00 rooks in the matrix.
Place 11 rook in the cell (1,1)(1,1). Since there is only one rook, no two rooks attack each other. Also, the cell in which the rook is placed has value 00. 
T=[0,0]T=[0,0]: There are 33 ways to place rooks:
Place 00 rooks in the matrix.
Place 11 rook in the cell (1,2)(1,2). Since there is only one rook, no two rooks attack each other. Also, the cell in which the rook is placed has value 00. 
Place 11 rook in the cell (1,1)(1,1). Since there is only one rook, no two rooks attack each other. Also, the cell in which the rook is placed has value 00. 

The total answer is the sum of number of ways in which we can place rooks over all the matrices. Thus, the answer is 2+2+3=72+2+3=7.

Explanation
This example has a beautiful explanation. Unfortunately, it is too long to write.
