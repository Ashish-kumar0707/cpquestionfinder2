Consider a grid with HH rows (numbered 11 through HH) and WW columns (numbered 11 through WW). Let's denote the value in a cell in row ii and column jj by hi,jhi,j. NN particles (numbered 11 through NN) are distributed in the cells in such a way that there is at most one particle in each cell. For each valid ii, the ii-th particle has a value pipi and it is placed in the cell in row yiyi and column xixi.
Let's denote the set of all particles by PP and the set of all unordered pairs of particles that are located in side-adjacent cells by EE. We define the value of the grid as
V=∑i∈Ppi⋅hyi,xi+∑(i,j)∈Epi⋅pj.V=∑i∈Ppi⋅hyi,xi+∑(i,j)∈Epi⋅pj.
You are given the grid and the locations of all particles, but not their exact values ― only |p1|,|p2|,…,|pN||p1|,|p2|,…,|pN|. Your task is to choose the sign of each value pipi in such a way that the value VV is maximum possible. Each sign may be chosen independently from all other signs.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers HH, WW and NN.
HH lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains WW space-separated integers hi,1,hi,2,…,hi,Whi,1,hi,2,…,hi,W.
NN more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers yiyi, xixi and |pi||pi|.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum value of VV.
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be 11 if you choose a positive sign for the value of the ii-th particle (i.e. its value should be |pi||pi|) or −1−1 if you choose a negative sign (i.e. its value should be −|pi|−|pi|).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
