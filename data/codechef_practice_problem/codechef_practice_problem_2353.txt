Sonya has NN segments on the xx-axis. For each valid ii, the ii-th segment contains all points between lili and riri inclusive.
Maks gave Sonya a magic number KK. Sonya wants to choose exactly KK of her segments in such a way that the intersection of the chosen segments is empty, i.e. there is no point which is contained in each of the chosen segments. Find the number of ways in which Sonya can choose KK segments. Since this number can be large, Sonya only needs to know its remainder modulo 10000000071000000007 (109+7109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers lili and riri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose the segments, modulo 10000000071000000007 (109+7109+7).

Explanation
Example case 1: We are looking for pairs of segments. The four pairs with empty intersections are (1,3)(1,3), (1,5)(1,5), (2,5)(2,5) and (4,5)(4,5).
