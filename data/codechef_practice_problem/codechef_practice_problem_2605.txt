Chefland consists of NN villages connected by N−1N−1 roads in such a way that the road network is a tree, i.e. there are no cycles and each village is reachable from any other village. A well known legend says that in the middle of each road, there is a hidden precious stone. There are KK different colours of stones, conveniently numbered 11 through KK, and for each road, we also know the colour of the stone hidden there.
King Chef wants a new beautiful crown, so he organises an expedition to find some stones in the following way:

Chef chooses a set of MM villages to be the expedition basis, in such a way that they form a connected subgraph of Chefland, i.e. for any two villages in the basis, the path between them must not visit any village that is not in the basis.
The expedition gathers the stones in all roads which lie on the "frontier" of the expedition basis, i.e. all edges for which one endpoint lies in the basis and the other endpoint does not.

For each of the 2K2K possible sets of colours, Chef wants to know if it is possible that the expedition will return with exactly this set, i.e. there is a basis such that the expedition returns with at least one stone of each colour in this set and no stones with colours that are not in this set.
Since Chef is not sure about the size of the expedition crew, he also wants you to find these answers for each possible value of MM.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and cc, denoting that villages uu and vv are connected by a road and in this road, there is a stone with colour cc.

Output
Let's associate a set SS of colours with a bitmask ∑c∈S2c−1∑c∈S2c−1.
For each test case, print NN lines. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines should contain 2K2K integers but not separated by spaces; for each jj (0≤j<2K0≤j<2K), the j+1j+1-th integer should be 11 if it is possible to obtain the set with bitmask jj for M=iM=i or 00 if it is impossible.

Explanation
Example case 1:
For M=1M=1, there are three subtrees:

only vertex 11: we obtain the set {1}{1} with bitmask 11
only vertex 22: we obtain the set {1,2}{1,2} with bitmask 33
only vertex 33: we obtain the set {2}{2} with bitmask 22

For M=2M=2, there are two possible subtrees:

vertices {1,2}{1,2}: we obtain the set {2}{2} with bitmask 22
vertices {2,3}{2,3}: we obtain the set {1}{1} with bitmask 11

For M=3M=3, we can only choose the whole tree, which generates the empty set (with bitmask 00).
