You are the ruler of a kingdom, and your cities have been infected with some mysterious disease!
Formally, the kingdom may be represented as a graph with NN cities, conveniently labeled 11 through NN, and MM unweighted bidirectional roads between them. This graph is guaranteed to be connected, and it contains no self-loops or multiple edges.
You would like to get rid of the infection. Initially, you have a cure, which you may send to a chosen subset of cities; these cities immediately become cured. Let's denote the cost of sending the cure to city ii by wiwi. The cost of sending a cure to a subset of cities is the sum of costs of sending the cure to each city from this subset.
Luckily, you do not have to send your cure to all cities immediately, since you can also spread it according to the following process: While there is at least one remaining diseased (not yet cured) city, choose a diseased city such that there is a road between this city and a cured city, and make this city also cured (at no additional cost). This process happens one city at a time, until all cities are cured.
To make sure the infection does not mutate, one more condition should be satisfied: the disease must be contained in a single connected subgraph at each point before and during this process. Formally, whenever you are choosing a city to cure, the subgraph created by removing all cities that are already cured (and roads with at least one endpoint in them) must be connected.
Find the minimum cost of distributing the cure to initially cured cities in such a way that it is possible to cure all cities by spreading the cure to them according to the process described above. Also, find some strategy, i.e. the subset of initially cured cities and the sequence of cities cured afterwards using this process, with this minimum cost.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers w1,w2,…,wNw1,w2,…,wN.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers aa and bb denoting a road between cities aa and bb.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain a single integer KK denoting the number of cities you send the cure to initially.
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN with the following meaning:
p1,p2,…,pKp1,p2,…,pK denote the labels of the cities you send the cure to initially.
For each ii (1≤i≤N−K1≤i≤N−K), pK+ipK+i denotes the ii-th city cured by spreading the cure to it.

Your output must satisfy the following constraints:

1≤K≤N1≤K≤N

Explanation
Example case 1: The graph is a star with city 11 in the centre. Initially, we can send the cure to cities 44 and 22 with cost 3+5=83+5=8. Then, we can spread the cure to city 11 and then to city 33.
Example case 2: Initially, we can send the cure to city 44, with cost 1010.
