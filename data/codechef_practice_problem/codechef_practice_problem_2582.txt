A string is almost palindromic if we can rearrange its characters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome. A positive integer is almost palindromic if its decimal representation without leading zeros is an almost palindromic string.
You are given two integers LL and RR. Find the number of almost palindromic integers between LL and RR (inclusive). Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR (without leading zeros).

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of almost palindromic integers modulo 109+7109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤L≤R<101061≤L≤R<10106
the sum of lengths of RR over all test cases does not exceed 106106
