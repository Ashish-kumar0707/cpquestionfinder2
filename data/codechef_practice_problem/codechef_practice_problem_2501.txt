Chef is making NN atomic soups numbered 11 through NN. Each soup is either a base atomic soup or a composition of other atomic soups. For each valid ii, if soup ii is not a base soup, one unit of this soup is made by mixing together one unit of soup ci,1ci,1, one unit of soup ci,2ci,2, and so on to one unit of soup ci,Pici,Pi. Note that these PiPi soup units are not necessarily from distinct soups and that we obtain only 11 unit of soup by mixing PiPi units.
Due to their structure, two units of the same base atomic soup always cancel out and vanish when mixed together. Therefore, we define the base decomposition of a soup as the set of all base atomic soups that need to be used an odd number of times when making the resulting soup (i.e. a base soup bb belongs to the base decomposition if we need to use an odd number of units of soup bb in total). The base decomposition of a sequence of atomic soups is the base decomposition of the soup created by mixing together one unit of each of these soups.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given a sequence of Chef's soups s1,s2,…,sKs1,s2,…,sK; you must decide whether it is possible to choose two disjoint subsequences (one of which may be empty) of this sequence which have the same base decomposition. Two subsequences are disjoint if there is no index ii such that each subsequence contains soup sisi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains an integer PiPi; if Pi≠0Pi≠0, it is followed by a space and PiPi space-separated integers ci,1,ci,2,…,ci,Pici,1,ci,2,…,ci,Pi.
The next line contains a single integer QQ.
The following QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains an integer KK followed by a space and KK space-separated integers s1,s2,…,sKs1,s2,…,sK.

Output
Print a single line containing a string with length QQ. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should be '1' if it is possible to choose required subsequences in the ii-th query or '0' otherwise.

Explanation
Soups 11, 22 and 44 are base atomic soups. The base decompositions of the other soups are:

soup 33: {1,2}{1,2}
soup 55: {1,2,4}{1,2,4}
soup 66: {1,2}{1,2} (two units of soup 22 cancel out)
soup 77: {2,4}{2,4}
soup 88: {1,4}{1,4}

For the first query, we can choose subsequences [3,4][3,4] and [5][5]. The base decomposition of subsequence {3,4}{3,4} is {1,2,4}{1,2,4}, which is the same as the base decomposition of soup 55.
For the last query, we can choose subsequences [6,8][6,8] and [7][7]. The base decomposition of each subsequence is {2,4}{2,4}, because two units of soup 11 cancel out. You may notice that the chosen subsequences do not form a partition of all KK given soups, since soup 55 was not used at all.
