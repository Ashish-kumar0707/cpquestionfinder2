An array of integers is called good if all its elements are perfect squares. 
You are given an array AA of NN integers. In one move, you can do the following:

Pick a subset of indices of the array, say {i1,i2,…,ik}{i1,i2,…,ik} where 1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤N1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤N
Next, pick an integer X>0X>0
Finally, multiply the value at each chosen index by XX, i.e, set AijAij to Aij⋅XAij⋅X for each 1≤j≤k1≤j≤k

Find the minimum number of moves required to make the array good.
Note: The value of XX is fixed for a given move, but can vary between moves.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains NN, the size of the array.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum number of moves required to make the array good.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1041≤N≤104
1≤Ai≤1081≤Ai≤108
The sum of NN across all testcases won't exceed 104104.

Explanation
Test case 11: One possible sequence of moves is:

Multiply the first element by 1515
Multiply the second element by 22

The array is now [225,4,4]=[152,22,22][225,4,4]=[152,22,22], which is good.
Test case 33: One possible sequence of moves is:

Multiply the first and third elements by 88
Multiply the second and third elements by 33
Multiply the first element by 2020

The array is now [1600,9,144]=[402,32,122][1600,9,144]=[402,32,122], which is good.
Test case 44: The array is already good, since [4,9]=[22,32][4,9]=[22,32], so no moves need to be made.
