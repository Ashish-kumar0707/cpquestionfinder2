Let's define a function P(A)P(A) for a sequence AA as the number of ways to divide AA into contiguous subsequences such that each element of AA belongs to exactly one of these subsequences and the sum of elements of each subsequence is between LL and RR inclusive.
For each integer nn between 11 and NN inclusive, solve the following problem: Consider a random sequence AA with length nn where each element is an integer between 11 and KK chosen uniformly randomly and independently. Find the expected value of P(A)P(A).
For each valid nn, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q−1Q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, KK, LL and RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 for n=in=i.

Explanation
Example case 1: For n=1n=1, we have P([1])=P([2])=1P([1])=P([2])=1 and P(A)=0P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is 2/2=12/2=1.
For n=2n=2, there are four valid sequences [1,1][1,1], [1,2][1,2], [2,1][2,1] and [2,2][2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition, [1,1][1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so P([1,1])=2P([1,1])=2. The expected value is (2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266(2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266.
