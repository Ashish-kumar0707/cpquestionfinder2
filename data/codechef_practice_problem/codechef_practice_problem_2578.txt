There is a country which has nn houses and mm bi-directional roads between these houses, where the ithith road connects house uiui to vivi. A subset of these houses SS is called a city if any house in SS is reachable from any other house in SS. Formally, a subset of houses SS is a city if xx and yy are reachable from each other for all x,y∈Sx,y∈S. The funding required for a city SS consisting of kk houses is defined as k2k2.
The president has given the mayor Saarang an order: divide the country into 22 cities with exactly one road connecting them. In other words, divide the country into two cities S1S1 and S2S2 such that:

Each house ii either belongs to S1S1 or S2S2.
There exists a single road connect a house xx from S1S1 and a house yy from S2S2.

For this purpose, you are allowed to build more bi-directional roads. The funding required to build a road between any 22 houses is cc.
Saarang, however, is busy preparing for his board exams so he requests you to solve this problem for him. Find the minimum total funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or −1−1 if no division is possible.
Note: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 22 cities and the roads built. If after the division, the two cities have xx and n−xn−x houses respectively and you have built a total of aa roads, The total funding will be x2+(n−x)2+c×ax2+(n−x)2+c×a.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case consists of three integers nn, mm and cc.
mm lines follow, each consisting of 22 integers uiui and vivi indicating a road between houses uiui and vivi.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or −1−1 if no division is possible.

Explanation
                    - Test case 11: there is no way to divide the country according to the mayor's requirements.

- Test case 22: consider the 22 cities consisting of {2,3,5,6}{2,3,5,6} and {1,4}{1,4} houses respectively. There are no new roads built. The total funding is 42+22=2042+22=20. This is the optimal assignment.



- Test case 33: build a road between 22 and 44. Consider the 22 cities consisting of {3,5,6}{3,5,6} and {1,2,4}{1,2,4} houses respectively. The total funding is 32+32+7×1=2532+32+7×1=25. This is the optimal assignment.



- Test case 44: build a road between 22 and 44 and between 55 and 77. Consider the 22 cities consisting of {1,2,4,7}{1,2,4,7} and {3,5,6}{3,5,6} houses respectively. The total funding is 42+32+4×2=3342+32+4×2=33. This is the optimal assignment.



Note for all test cases that there may be multiple ways to get the same funding but there is no other division which has a smaller funding.
