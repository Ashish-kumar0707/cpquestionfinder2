Find KK distinct numbers in the range [1,N][1,N] such that the bitwise XOR of all the numbers is maximized. Print any set of these numbers that maximize the XOR.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers NN, KK. 

Output
For each test case, output KK distinct integers in any order as described in the problem.

Explanation
Test Case 11: The only possible set is {10}{10} which gives the value 1010.
Test Case 22: The other possible set is {9,6}{9,6} which gives the value 9⊕6=15=7⊕89⊕6=15=7⊕8.
Test Case 33: The only possible set is {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}{1,2,3,4,5,6,8} which gives the value 1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5⊕6⊕8=151⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5⊕6⊕8=15.
