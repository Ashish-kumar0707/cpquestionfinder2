Ghayeeth is a math teacher. He likes playing games, so he invented a new game which he wants to play against his student Siroj. The rules of the game are as follows:

Initially, Ghayeeth writes the numbers  A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN on a whiteboard and a number Z=0Z=0 on a piece of paper.
Ghayeeth and Siroj alternate turns; Ghayeeth goes first.
In each turn, the current player must pick a number that is currently written on the whiteboard, add it to ZZ and erase it from the whiteboard.
After each turn, if there is no pair of positive integers (a,b)(a,b) such that Z=a2−b2Z=a2−b2, then the last player who made a move loses the game.
Otherwise, if there are no more numbers on the whiteboard, the last player who made a move wins the game.

Help Ghayeeth determine the winner of this game.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Ghayeeth" or "Siroj" (without quotes) — the name of the winner.
