MoEngage gives you an array AA of length NN.
You are required to perform exactly (N−1)(N−1) operations on the array. In one operation, you have to pick two indices ii and jj (1≤i<j≤N)(1≤i<j≤N) and do the following:

Remove the elements AiAi and AjAj from array.
Append |Ai−Aj||Ai−Aj| to the array.

Note that, after each operation, the size of the array is reduced by one. Thus, after (N−1)(N−1) operations, only one element remains in the array.
Find the number of distinct values the remaining element can have after (N−1)(N−1) operations.
Input Format

First line of the input contains TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer NN denoting the length of the array.
Second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers describing the array AA.

Output Format
For each test case, print the number of distinct values the remaining element can have after (N−1)(N−1) operations.

Explanation

Test Case 11:  The given array is [4,8,5][4,8,5]. There are two possible values the remaining element can have after all the operations. These values are 11 and 77.

To get 11, we first choose i=1i=1 and j=2j=2. We remove the elements 44 and 88 and append |4−8|=4|4−8|=4 to the array. After performing the operation, A=[5,4]A=[5,4]. Next, we choose i=1i=1 and j=2j=2. After performing the operation, A=[1]A=[1].
To get 77, we first choose i=1i=1 and j=3j=3. We remove the elements 44 and 55 and append |4−5|=1|4−5|=1 to the array. After performing the operation, A=[8,1]A=[8,1]. Next, we choose i=1i=1 and j=2j=2. After performing the operation, A=[7]A=[7].
Test Case 22 : The given array is [1][1]. No operations are possible in the array. So, the only possible value of the remaining element is 11.
Test Case 33 : The given array is [2,4][2,4]. The only possible value of the remaining element after performing one operation is 22.
