Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He wants to sort it in non-decreasing order. Unfortunately, he can only modify it using specific operations. In each operation, Chef should do the following:

Choose an integer KK such that 0<K<2300<K<230.
Choose an integer PP such that 1≤P≤N1≤P≤N.
Perform one of the following actions:
type t=1t=1: for each ii (1≤i≤P1≤i≤P), change AiAi to Ai+KAi+K
type t=2t=2: for each ii (P≤i≤NP≤i≤N), change AiAi to Ai+KAi+K
type t=3t=3: for each ii (1≤i≤P1≤i≤P), change AiAi to Ai⊕KAi⊕K
type t=4t=4: for each ii (P≤i≤NP≤i≤N), change AiAi to Ai⊕KAi⊕K

Here, ⊕⊕ denotes bitwise XOR. In different operations, Chef may choose different values of tt, KK and PP.
Can you help Chef make the sequence non-decreasing using at most ⌊N/2⌋⌊N/2⌋ operations (possibly 00 times)? Find one such sequence of operations.
Note that you do not need to minimise the number of operations. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It is guaranteed that a solution using at most ⌊N/2⌋⌊N/2⌋ operations always exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case:

First, print a line containing a single integer XX ― the number of operations you want to perform (0≤X≤⌊N/2⌋0≤X≤⌊N/2⌋).
Then, print XX lines. Each of these lines should contain three space-separated integers tt, PP and KK describing an operation (1≤t≤41≤t≤4).

3≤N≤1033≤N≤103
0≤Ai<2300≤Ai<230 for each valid ii

Explanation
Example case 1: After changing A2A2 to 10⊕1110⊕11 and A3A3 to 9⊕119⊕11, the sequence becomes [1,1,2][1,1,2], which is non-decreasing.
Example case 2: In the first operation, we change A4A4 to 1⊕41⊕4 and the sequence becomes [4,3,5,5][4,3,5,5]. Then, we add 22 to A2A2, A3A3 and A4A4. The sequence becomes [4,5,7,7][4,5,7,7], which is non-decreasing.
Example case 3: After the first operation, the sequence AA becomes [0,1,3,3,7,5][0,1,3,3,7,5]. After the second operation, the sequence becomes [0,1,1,1,5,7][0,1,1,1,5,7], which is non-decreasing.
Example case 4: After performing the only operation, the sequence becomes [4,5,6][4,5,6], which is non-decreasing.
Example case 5: The sequence [1,2,3][1,2,3] is already non-decreasing, so we do not need to perform any operations.
