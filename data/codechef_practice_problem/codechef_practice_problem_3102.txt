Data pipelines are very important in dealing with big data. A data pipeline takes data from some source stream(s), processes this data and sends it to output stream(s).
Codechef Beam is an example of such a pipeline. This pipeline takes data from NsNs source streams and it is expected to send data to NoeNoe output streams. However, the actual number of output streams may be different.
Internally, Beam calculates a parameter K=⌈Ns/Noe⌉K=⌈Ns/Noe⌉: the maximum number of source streams that may be sent to a single output stream. Then, output streams are created. The first KK input streams are assigned to one output stream, the next KK input streams to a second output stream and so on, until there are less than KK unassigned input streams. Then, if the number of unassigned input streams is positive, another output stream is created and all those unassigned input streams are assigned to it. For example, for Ns=35Ns=35, Noe=20Noe=20, we have K=2K=2 and the actual number of output streams is 1818: 1717 output streams taking 22 input streams each and one output stream taking 11 input stream.
You are given NoeNoe, the maximum possible number of input streams MM and the desired final number of output streams NofNof. Find the number of integers xx from 11 to MM (inclusive) such that if Ns=xNs=x, Codechef Beam sends data to exactly NofNof output streams.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers MM, NoeNoe and NofNof.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible values of NsNs satisfying the given criteria.

Explanation
Example case 1: The number of input streams NsNs can be 1818, 3535 or 3636.
Example case 2: The number of input streams must be 55, since the number of output streams cannot be 55 otherwise.
