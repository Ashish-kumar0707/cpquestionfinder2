You are given two binary strings AA and BB, each of length NN.
Consider a non-empty substring A′A′ of AA and a non-empty substring B′B′ of BB, both of the same length. Let X=A′⊕B′X=A′⊕B′ be the string obtained by taking the exclusive OR of A′A′ and B′B′.
You are also given a function f(X)f(X), defined as
f(X)=⌊|X|2X10⌋f(X)=⌊|X|2X10⌋
where |X||X| denotes the length of XX and X10X10 denotes the decimal value of the binary integer represented by XX. For example, if X=0110101X=0110101, then |X|=7|X|=7 and X10=53X10=53, so f(X)=⌊7/253⌋=0f(X)=⌊7/253⌋=0.
Your task is to maximize the value of the function f(X)f(X) for the given strings AA and BB, by choosing A′A′ and B′B′ appropriately.
Note: The exclusive OR of two binary strings AA and BB such that |A|=|B|=k|A|=|B|=k is the unique binary string XX of length kk such that Xi=1Xi=1 if and only if Ai≠BiAi≠Bi.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN — the length of the binary strings AA and BB.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string AA of length NN.
The third line of each test case contains a binary string BB of length NN.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum value of the function.

Explanation
Test case 11: We calculate the value of f(X)f(X) for a few choices of XX:

If A′=10A′=10 and B′=01B′=01, then X=11X=11. This gives f(X)=⌊2/23⌋=⌊2/8⌋=0f(X)=⌊2/23⌋=⌊2/8⌋=0
If A′=01A′=01 and B′=10B′=10, then X=11X=11. This gives f(X)=⌊2/23⌋=0f(X)=⌊2/23⌋=0
If A′=10A′=10 and B′=10B′=10, then X=00X=00. This gives f(X)=⌊2/20⌋=2f(X)=⌊2/20⌋=2
If A′=101A′=101 and B′=010B′=010, then X=111X=111. This gives f(X)=⌊3/27⌋=0f(X)=⌊3/27⌋=0

It can be verified that the maximum value of ff is 22.
