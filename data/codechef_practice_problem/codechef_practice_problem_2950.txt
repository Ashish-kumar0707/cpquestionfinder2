Consider an undirected graph GG with NN vertices and MM edges. A line graph L(G)L(G) of this graph is a graph with MM vertices; each of these vertices corresponds to an edge in GG and two vertices in L(G)L(G) are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in GG have a common vertex.
Let Lk(G)Lk(G) denote the result of performing the operation "replace GG by L(G)L(G)" kk times, i.e. L1(G)=L(G)L1(G)=L(G), L2(G)=L(L(G))L2(G)=L(L(G)), L3(G)=L(L(L(G)))L3(G)=L(L(L(G))) and so on.
You are given an undirected simple graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges, and a positive integer KK. Find the size of the largest independent set in LK(G)LK(G). Since this value may be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of vertices in the largest independent set in LK(G)LK(G), modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
