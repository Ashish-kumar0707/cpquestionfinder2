You are given NN sequences P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN. Each of them is a permutation of numbers 11 through MM.
Let's define a product of two permutations XX and YY of numbers 11 through MM as a permutation Z=X⋅YZ=X⋅Y such that Zi=YXiZi=YXi for each valid ii.
You should answer QQ queries. Each query is described by two numbers LL and RR. Let's define a permutation B=PL⋅PL+1⋅…⋅PRB=PL⋅PL+1⋅…⋅PR; the multiplication of permutations is evaluated left to right, i.e. as ((PL⋅PL+1)⋅…)⋅PR((PL⋅PL+1)⋅…)⋅PR. The answer to a query is ∑Mi=1i⋅Bi∑i=1Mi⋅Bi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains MM space-separated integers Pi,1,Pi,2,…,Pi,MPi,1,Pi,2,…,Pi,M denoting the permutation PiPi.
The next line contains a single integer QQ.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing one query.

Output
For each test case, print QQ lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the answer to the ii-th query.

Explanation
Example case 1: 

query 1: B=[3,2,1]B=[3,2,1], so the answer is 1⋅3+2⋅2+3⋅1=101⋅3+2⋅2+3⋅1=10
query 2: B=[3,1,2]B=[3,1,2], the answer is 1111
query 3: B=[2,3,1]B=[2,3,1], the answer is 1111
query 4: B=[1,2,3]B=[1,2,3], the answer is 1414
query 5: B=[2,3,1]B=[2,3,1], the answer is 1111
