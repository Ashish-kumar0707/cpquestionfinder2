Cherry has a string SS consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:

NN-th row of pyramid contains NN characters.
Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).

He has another string TT of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked QQ queries. Each query is provided with a row number NN. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string TT in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String TT in a string VV would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...VjVi,Vi+1...Vj which are equal to String TT, where i≤ji≤j.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

Input:

The first line contains string SS — consisting of lowercase English letters.
The second line contains string TT — consisting of lowercase English letters.
Next line contains an integer QQ — the number of queries.
Then follow QQ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer NN denoting the row number of pyramid.

Output:

Print QQ lines. The ii-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string TT in that particular row.
