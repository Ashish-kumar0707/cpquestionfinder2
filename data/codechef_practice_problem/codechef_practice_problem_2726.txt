Consider a permutation PP of length NN. We call a subarray of PP good if it contains the value XX. 
Consider a set SS containing maximum elements of all good subarrays of PP.
Permutation PP is called beautiful if SS contains exactly KK distinct values.
Given three integers NN, XX, and KK, you need to find the number of beautiful permutations of length NN. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 998244353998244353.
Note: A subarray is obtained from an array by removing some elements (possibly none) from the beginning and some elements (possibly none) from the end of the array.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, XX, and KK - the length of the permutation, the pivot value XX, and the number of different values the maximum element of the focused subarrays can take on.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of beautiful permutations modulo 998244353998244353.

Explanation

Test case 11: There are 22 beautiful permutations:
[1,3,2][1,3,2]. In this permutation, there are three subarrays that contain the pivot value 11: [1][1], [1,3][1,3], and [1,3,2][1,3,2]. The maximum elements for these subarrays are 11, 33, and 33 respectively. So there are exactly 22 distinct values of maximum on these subarrays.
[2,3,1][2,3,1]. In this permutation, there are three subarrays that contain the pivot value 11: [1][1], [3,1][3,1], and [2,3,1][2,3,1]. The maximum elements for these subarrays are 11, 33, and 33 respectively. So there are exactly 22 distinct values of maximum on these subarrays.
