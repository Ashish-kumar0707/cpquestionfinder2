Chef recently accepted a teaching fellowship at a prestigious culinary institution. The fellowship does not begin for a while yet, so Chef wants to use the remaining free time for a nice vacation. There are NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by MM roads. For each valid ii, there are LiLi tourist attractions in city ii. Chef is initially in city 11 and he will teach in city NN. On each day of his vacation, Chef wants to perform one of the following actions:

Travel to a city with a higher number than his current city which is directly connected to his current city by a road. At the end of his vacation, Chef must be in city NN.
Visit a tourist attraction in his current city. Chef may visit each tourist attraction repeatedly (on different days).

Chef has not yet decided for how many days the vacation should last. He has QQ queries described by a sequence D1,D2,…,DQD1,D2,…,DQ. For each query, i.e. for each ii (1≤i≤Q1≤i≤Q), he would like to know the number of different vacation plans if he wants his vacation to last exactly DiDi days. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.
Two vacation plans (for a fixed duration of the vacation) are considered different if there is at least one day such that Chef performs different actions in the two plans on that day. Visiting different tourist attractions also counts as different actions.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers L1,L2,…,LNL1,L2,…,LN.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that cities uu and vv are connected by a road.
The last line contains QQ space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DQD1,D2,…,DQ.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible vacations modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.

Explanation
Since there is no road directly connecting city 11 to city 44, there are no valid vacations that only last 1 day, so the answer to the first query is 00.
There are two ways to get to city 44 in 2 days ? either travel from city 11 to city 22 on the first day and from city 22 to city 44 on the second day, or travel from city 11 to city 33 on the first day and from city 33 to city 44 on the second day. Neither option gives Chef any time for sightseeing, though.
With 3 days, Chef can spend one day at a tourist attraction and the other two days travelling, with 30 possible trips in total.
