Chef decided to order NN lemons for a future Lemon Festival. The company "LemEx" that delivers lemons provides 3,0003,000 yellow trucks and one red truck, and Chef wants to fully use them all. The trucks have identical capacities, so Chef wants each truck to transfer the same number of lemons.
You are given a string MM and an integer KK. The decimal representation of the number NN can be obtained by concatenating MM with itself KK times, e.g. if M=903M=903 and K=3K=3, it means that N=903903903N=903903903. You are not allowed to add any leading zeroes to this decimal representation, however, it may initially contain leading zeroes.
It could be possible that NN lemons cannot be delivered while satisfying the given rule. Therefore, Chef may change an arbitrary number of digits (possibly zero) in the decimal representation of NN, i.e. choose a number of positions in this string and change each of the digits at these positions to a different digit. However, it is not allowed to change two or more digits with identical original values (at different positions). There are no restrictions on the resulting values of any digits; specifically, the resulting number is also allowed to contain leading zeroes.
Find the number of ways to change the number NN so that all lemons can be delivered by LemEx. Since this number can be very large, we ask you to compute it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a string MM, followed by a space and an integer KK. 
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to change the number of lemons modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
We have MM equal to "3012" and K=1K=1, so N=3012N=3012 (once repeated MM). The decimal representation of NN can be changed to "0000" (the number 00), "3001", "6002" or "9003".
