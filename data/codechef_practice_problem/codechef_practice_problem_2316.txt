You are given two strings PP and QQ. Consider some uniformly randomly and independently chosen non-empty prefix XX and non-empty suffix YY of PP. A string ZZ is formed by concatenating XX and YY in this order. Find the probability that ZZ is a substring of QQ.
It can be shown that the answer can be represented as a fraction U/VU/V, where UU and VV are non-negative integers and VV is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute U⋅V−1U⋅V−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where V−1V−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of VV modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string PP.
The second line contains a single string QQ.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer U⋅V−1U⋅V−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are 44 possible prefixes XX and 44 suffixes YY. The only combinations that result in a string ZZ that is a substring of QQ are:

XX = "a", YY = "ac"
XX = "a", YY = "c"
XX = "ab", YY = "c"

The probability that ZZ is a substring of QQ is 3/163/16.
