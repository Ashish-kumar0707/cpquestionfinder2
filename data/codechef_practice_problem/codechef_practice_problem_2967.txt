NN people (numbered 11 through NN) are trying to catch Chef because he has a secret recipe for the most delicious biryani ever. Chef does not have a number.
The chase starts at time t=0t=0 and takes place on a circular road with length LL. Positions on the road are described by one real-valued coordinate; for each real number xx, position x+Lx+L is the same as position xx. Chef's initial position is Xc=0Xc=0 and for each valid ii, the initial position of the ii-th person is XiXi.
Chef's maximum velocity is VcVc and for each valid ii, the maximum velocity of the ii-th person is ViVi. At each moment in time, any person (including Chef) with maximum velocity VV may choose any velocity vv (a real number) between −V−V and VV inclusive, possibly different at different moments in time, independently from all other people and this person's velocity at all other moments in time. All people move continuously — for any very small time difference ΔtΔt, a person at a position xx and with a velocity vv at time tt is approximately at the position x+v⋅Δtx+v⋅Δt at time t+Δtt+Δt.
When Chef is at the same position as one of the NN people at the same moment in time, he is considered caught and the chase ends. It can be proved that Chef is unable to keep escaping forever; formally, there is a real number TuTu such that Chef can always be caught at a finite time which does not exceed TuTu, regardless of his choices.
The NN people want to catch Chef at the smallest possible time, while Chef wants to maximise the time when he will be caught. Find the time at which Chef gets caught if all people act optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, LL and VcVc.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers X1,X2,…,XNX1,X2,…,XN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers V1,V2,…,VNV1,V2,…,VN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the time when Chef gets caught. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6.
