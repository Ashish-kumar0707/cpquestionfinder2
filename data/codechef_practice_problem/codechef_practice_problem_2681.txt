Chef has a string SS with length NN and integer KK. Let's consider all strings that can be obtained by erasing KK consecutive characters from the original string ― specifically, for each ii (1≤i≤N−K+11≤i≤N−K+1), let f(i)f(i) be the string that is obtained by erasing the characters at positions i,i+1,…,i+K−1i,i+1,…,i+K−1.
Consider a permutation PP of the integers 11 through N−K+1N−K+1. You need to find the lexicographically smallest permutation PP such that f(Pi)≤f(Pi+1)f(Pi)≤f(Pi+1) for each ii (1≤i≤N−K1≤i≤N−K).
Since the length of this permutation can be too large, you should only compute its hash: ∑N−K+1i=1Pi⋅i∑i=1N−K+1Pi⋅i modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains a single string SS with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the hash of the lexicographically smallest valid permutation.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤K<N≤1071≤K<N≤107
SS contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 107107

Explanation
Example case 1: f(1)f(1) and f(2)f(2) are both "a", the lexicographically smallest permutation is P=[1,2]P=[1,2]. The answer is 1⋅1+2⋅2=41⋅1+2⋅2=4.
Example case 2: f(1)f(1) is "cde", f(2)f(2) is "ade", f(3)f(3) is "abe", f(4)f(4) is "abc". The lexicographically smallest valid permutation is P=[4,3,2,1]P=[4,3,2,1] and the answer is 4⋅1+3⋅2+2⋅3+1⋅4=204⋅1+3⋅2+2⋅3+1⋅4=20.
