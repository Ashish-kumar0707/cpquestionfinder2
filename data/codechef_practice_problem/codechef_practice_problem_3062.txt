Given an array of size NN and two integers KK and SS, the special sum of a subarray is defined as follows:
(Sum of all elements of the subarray) * (KK - pp * SS)
Where pp = number of distinct prime factors of “product of all elements of the subarray”.
Find the maximum special sum by considering all non-empty subarrays of the given array.
Input

First line contains 3 integers NN, KK and SS.     
Second line contains NN integers, the elements of the array.  

Output
Output a single integer. The maximum special sum considering all non-empty subarrays of the array.
Constraints:

1≤N,K,S≤1051≤N,K,S≤105 
0≤K/S≤200≤K/S≤20 
1<1< Any element of array <105<105

Sample Input
4 10 2
14 2 7 15
Sample Output
138
Sample Explanation
Consider the subarray {14, 2, 7}
Total number of distinct prime factors in it is 2 (2 and 7).
Therefore, value of special sum is (14 + 2 + 7) * (10 - 2 * 2) = 138.
This is the subarray with the maximum special sum.
