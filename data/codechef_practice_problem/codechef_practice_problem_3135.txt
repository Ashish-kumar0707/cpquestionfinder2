Chef has an array a1,…,ana1,…,an of nn elements. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 11. There are two types of operations. 

11 ii:  Take the index ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and multiply it by 22 (ai:=2⋅aiai:=2⋅ai).
22 ii jj:  Take two indexes ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n,i≠j1≤i,j≤n,i≠j), and subtract ajaj from aiai, (ai:=ai−ajai:=ai−aj).

All elements must be positive after each operation, and at most 109109. 
In addition, you are given an array bb. Chef wants to make bb from aa. Help Chef to reach the array bb in no more than 43 00043 000 operations, or determine it is impossible.
Input:

The first line contains a single integer nn - size of the array.
The second line contains nn integers b1,…bnb1,…bn - the array bb. 

Output:
If it is impossible to reach bb, print −1−1.
Otherwise, output kk - the number of operations (0≤k≤43 0000≤k≤43 000). On the next kk lines, print the operations as described in the statement.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.

Explanation
Test Case 1: Initially, the array aa is [1,1,1][1,1,1].
By the first operation, a3:=2⋅a3a3:=2⋅a3, so the array becomes [1,1,2][1,1,2].
By the second operation, a3:=2⋅a3a3:=2⋅a3, so the array becomes [1,1,4][1,1,4].
By the third operation, a3:=a3−a1a3:=a3−a1, so the array becomes [1,1,3][1,1,3].
By the fourth operation, a2:=2⋅a2a2:=2⋅a2, so the array becomes [1,2,3][1,2,3]. Now the array is equal to bb, as desired.
