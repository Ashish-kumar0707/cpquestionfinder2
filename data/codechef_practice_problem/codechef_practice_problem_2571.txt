You are given a tree with NN nodes. For each unordered pair of distinct nodes (i,j)(i,j) such that there is no edge between nodes ii and jj, we add an edge between these nodes with probability 1/21/2.
For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), let pipi be the probability that the resulting graph has exactly ii 2-edge-connected components and let Ri=pi⋅2(N−1)(N−2)/2Ri=pi⋅2(N−1)(N−2)/2. You should compute RiRi modulo 109+7109+7 for each ii from 11 to NN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv.

Output
Print a single line containing NN space-separated integers R1,R2,…,RNR1,R2,…,RN.

Explanation
The only edge that can be added is (1,3)(1,3). If this edge is added, there will be one biconnected component; otherwise, there will be three biconnected components. Therefore, p1=p3=1/2p1=p3=1/2 and p2=0p2=0.
