You are given a directed weighted graph with PP vertices, labelled from 00 to P−1P−1. PP is a prime number. You are also given an integer KK. 
For each vertex uu, there is an edge from vertex uu to vertex (K⋅u+i)modP(K⋅u+i)modP for all 0≤i≤K−10≤i≤K−1. The weight of an edge directed from the vertex uu to the vertex (K⋅u+i)modP(K⋅u+i)modP is equal to ii.  
You will be given QQ queries. In each query you will be given two vertices XX and YY and you have to determine the minimum cost of going from XX to YY. If a path does not exists between XX and YY, print −1−1.
Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases TT. The description of TT testcases as follows.
The first line of each test contains 33 space separated integers P,K,QP,K,Q.
Then QQ lines follow. Each of the QQ lines contains two space separated integers XX and YY denoting a query.

Output Format
For each query print a single integer denoting the minimum cost of going from XX to YY. If a path does not exist print −1−1.
