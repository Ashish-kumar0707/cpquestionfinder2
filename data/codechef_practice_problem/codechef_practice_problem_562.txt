You are given two integers LL and RR. Find the smallest non-negative integer N such that
N%L>N%(L+1)>…>N%(R−1)>N%R.
Here, % is the modulo operator, so A%B is the remainder of A after division by B. For example, 11%3=2.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest possible N, or −1 if no solution exists.
It is guaranteed that when a solution exists, the smallest solution does not exceed 1018.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤L<R≤106


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
4 6
1 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





6
-1


Explanation
Example case 1: N=6 satisfies the given condition, since 6%4(=2)>6%5(=1)>6%6(=0). Notice that N=7 also satisfies the condition, but it is larger.
Example case 2: It is impossible to find a valid solution because for any non-negative integer N, we have N%1(=0)≤N%2.
