Some cooking competitions going on to be held in various cities and the Chef wants to participate in them. There are NN cities numbered from 11 to NN and they are connected by N−1N−1 roads such that every city is connected to every other city. But traveling is a bit different here. Every city ii is assigned a travel value, AiAi. From a city numbered XX, one can only travel to another city YY such that the simple path from XX to YY has exactly AXAX roads.
To participate in a city's competition, the Chef just has to visit it. Help the Chef by finding the maximum number of competitions he can participate in if he can start from any city and visit any city multiple times.
Formally, given a tree in which every node ii is assigned a value AiAi, you have to find the maximum number of distinct nodes that can be visited, if we can start from any node and visit any node multiple times. The only condition is that you can only move from node ii to jj if the number of edges between ii and jj is exactly AiAi.
Note: Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory, and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8MB. So, if you believe that your code requires larger stack limit, please include this in your code.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN (1≤N≤1051≤N≤105).
Next N−1N−1 lines contain 2 integers each, uiui and vivi, denoting a road between cities uiui and vivi.
Next line contains NN space separated integers, A1⋅⋅⋅ANA1⋅⋅⋅AN.

Output Format
In a single line, output the maximum number of cities that can be visited, starting from any one and visiting any city any number of times.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤ui,vi≤N1≤ui,vi≤N and ui≠viui≠vi
1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤109
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is also guaranteed that the sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
In example case 11,

From city 11, Chef can move only to cities 33 or 44.
From city 22, Chef can move only to city 11.
From city 33, Chef can move only to city 22.
From city 44, Chef can move only to city 55.
From city 55, Chef can move only to city 33.
Chef can follow the path 1→3→2→1→4→51→3→2→1→4→5, and visit every city.

In example case 22,

Chef can follow any path to visit all the vertices eventually. since every AiAi = 11. 

In example case 33,

Chef can follow the path 1→2→4→51→2→4→5.
There are other paths as well, but the maximum number would be 4 only.
