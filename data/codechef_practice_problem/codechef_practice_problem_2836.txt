You have a Greenhouse of height xx units (i.e plants with height > xx cannot be kept inside it) and nn plants whose initial heights are 
h1,h2…,hnh1,h2…,hn. These plants are of a special kind: they grow by 1 unit if watered. You have to keep these plants in the greenhouse for at most dd days. On the  ii’th day, you have to water exactly aiai different plants. You need to output the maximum number of days you can keep all the plants together inside the greenhouse (output dd if answer > dd). Of course, you shouldn't water a plant if it has reached the height of xx.
Input:

The first line contains the number of test cases TT.
For each test case: 
The first line contains xx, nn and dd.
The next line contains nn integers denoting h1,h2..hnh1,h2..hn.
The next line contains dd integers denoting a1,a2..ada1,a2..ad.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum number of days for which you can keep the plants in the greenhouse.
Constraints

1≤T≤51≤T≤5 
1≤x,d,n,hi≤1051≤x,d,n,hi≤105
1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n
It is guaranteed that hi<xhi<x initially.

Sample Input:
1
5 3 7
1 1 2
3 2 1 1 2 1 3

Sample Output:
6

Explanation:
Here is a possible answer. These are the heights of plants in different days -
Day 0: 1 1 2
Day 1: 2 2 3
Day 2: 3 3 3
Day 3: 3 3 4
Day 4: 3 4 4
Day 5: 4 4 5
Day 6: 4 5 5
On the 7th day the heights will be 5 6 6 so you can’t keep all the plants together. You can check that no other way of watering the plants will do any better. Hence the output is 6.
