Chef John is given NN points 𝖯1,𝖯2,…,𝖯NP1,P2,…,PN in a plane. For each valid ii, the coordinates of the point 𝖯iPi are (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Help him find a vector v→=(xv,yv)v→=(xv,yv) such that the following holds:

For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), let Si=v→⋅𝖯i𝖯i+1−→−−−Si=v→⋅PiPi+1→. Here, we define 𝖯N+1=𝖯1PN+1=P1.
The coordinates xvxv and yvyv are integers and |xv|,|yv|≤2⋅109|xv|,|yv|≤2⋅109.
It is possible to find three integers ww, ll and rr (1≤l≤r≤N1≤l≤r≤N) such that:
For each ii (l≤i≤rl≤i≤r), Siw>0Siw>0.
For each other valid ii, Siw<0Siw<0.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. If there are no solutions, let's define xv=yv=0xv=yv=0. (Note that the vector v→=(0,0)v→=(0,0) cannot be a valid solution.)
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers xvxv and yvyv.
