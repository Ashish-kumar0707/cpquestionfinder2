You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN); vertex 11 is the root. Initially, for each valid ii, the ii-th vertex has a weight wiwi. You should perform a sequence of QQ operations of the following two types:

Add xx to the weight of vertex vv.
Add xx to the weight of each vertex in the subtree of vertex vv (including vv).

Let's define a function f(u)=∑Ni=1wi⋅d(i,u)f(u)=∑i=1Nwi⋅d(i,u), where d(i,u)d(i,u) denotes the distance between vertices ii and uu. After each operation, find an integer uu such that f(u)f(u) is minimum amoung f(1),f(2),…,f(N)f(1),f(2),…,f(N), if there are multiple values of uu find smallest one.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers w1,w2,…,wNw1,w2,…,wN.
N−1N−1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.
Each of the next QQ lines contains three space-separated integers tt, vv and xx describing one operation, where tt denotes the type of the operation.

Output
Print QQ lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain one integer uu such that f(u)f(u) is minimum among f(1),f(2),…,f(N)f(1),f(2),…,f(N) after the ii-th operation, if there are multiple values of uu find smallest one.
