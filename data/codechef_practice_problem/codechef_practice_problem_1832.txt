Chef is learning English. So far, he knows NN words, and he wants to write a verse.
Let's call a pair of English words a stanza. A verse is a list of stanzas. The prefixal rhyme of a stanza is the longest common prefix of the words in it. Similarly, the suffixal rhyme of a stanza is the longest common suffix of the words in it. The beauty of a stanza whose prefixal and suffixal rhymes have lengths lplp and lsls respectively is min(lp,ls)2min(lp,ls)2.
For example, a stanza formed by the words "abcdefghijkl" and "abcxyzhijkl" has a prefixal rhyme "abc" (with length 33), suffixal rhyme "hijkl" (with length 55) and beauty min(3,5)2=32=9min(3,5)2=32=9.
The beauty of a verse is the sum of beauties of all its stanzas. For example, the beauty of the verse (("abcdefghijkl", "abcxyzhijkl"), ("world", "word"), ("code", "chef")) is 9+1+0=109+1+0=10.
You are given NN words W1,W2,…,WNW1,W2,…,WN (they are not necessarily distinct). Help Chef write the most beautiful verse. It is not necessary to use all the words, but each word may be used at most once in the whole verse (more precisely, each element of the sequence WW may be used only once, but if some word appears kk times in WW, we can use it up to kk times).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains a single string WiWi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the greatest possible beauty of Chef's verse.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤|Wi|≤1051≤|Wi|≤105 for each valid ii
all words contain only lowercase English letters
the sum of |W1|+|W2|+…+|WN||W1|+|W2|+…+|WN| over all test cases does not exceed 105105

Explanation
Example case 1: The best verse is (("abcdefghijkl", "abcxyzhijkl"), ("world", "word"), ("code", "chef")), which was described above.
Example case 2: The best verse is (("problem", "problem"), ("problem", "poem")). Its beauty is 72+12=49+1=5072+12=49+1=50. Note that we have three copies of the word "problem", so we can use it three times.
Example case 3: The best verse is (("coolest", "contest")), which contains only one stanza. Its beauty is 22=422=4. Note that it is not necessary to use all the words ? the word "unused" is left unused.
