You are given two integers NN and MM. You have to construct a matrix with NN rows and MM columns. Consider a multiset SS which contains N+MN+M integers: for each row and each column of this matrix, the MEX of the elements of this row/column belongs to SS. Then, in the matrix you construct, the MEX of SS must be maximum possible. 
Note: The MEX of a multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in this multiset. For example, MEX({4,9,0,1,1,5})=2MEX({4,9,0,1,1,5})=2 and MEX({1,2,3})=0MEX({1,2,3})=0.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.

Output
For each test case, print NN lines. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines should contain MM space-separated integers ― the elements in the ii-th row of your matrix. Each element of the matrix must be non-negative and must not exceed 109109.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤4001≤T≤400
1≤N,M≤1001≤N,M≤100
the sum of N⋅MN⋅M over all test cases does not exceed 105105

Example Input
2
3 3
4 2

Example Output
9 1 0
1 0 2
7 5 8
2 2
3 0
1 1
0 1

Explanation
Example case 1: The MEXs of the rows {9,1,0}{9,1,0}, {1,0,2}{1,0,2} and {7,5,8}{7,5,8} are 22, 33 and 00 respectively. The MEXs of the columns {9,1,7}{9,1,7}, {1,0,5}{1,0,5} and {0,2,8}{0,2,8} are 00, 22 and 11 respectively. Therefore, the multiset which contains the MEX of each row and each column is S={0,0,1,2,2,3}S={0,0,1,2,2,3} and MEX(S)=4MEX(S)=4. We can show that this is the largest MEX that can be obtained for a 3×33×3 matrix.
