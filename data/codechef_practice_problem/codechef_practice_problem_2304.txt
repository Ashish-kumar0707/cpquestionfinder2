Chef likes assigning scores to pairs of numbers in an unusual way:

Consider a pair (X,Y)(X,Y) of integers in decimal representation. If they don't have the same number of digits, add leading zeros to the smaller of these integers until they have the same number of digits. Let's denote the number of digits in each of the resulting decimal representations by DD.
Reorder the digits of YY in an arbitrary way.
For each ii (1≤i≤D1≤i≤D), calculate the absolute difference between the ii-th digit of XX and the ii-th digit of YY, and sum up these differences.
The score of the pair (X,Y)(X,Y) is the minimum possible value of this sum.

Consider the pair (3178,10920)(3178,10920) as an example. The scoring procedure would be:

Add a leading zero to XX, so the decimal representations are "03178" and "10920".
Reorder "10920" e.g. to "01029".
The score is |0−0|+|3−1|+|1−0|+|7−2|+|8−9|=9|0−0|+|3−1|+|1−0|+|7−2|+|8−9|=9, since it is impossible to achieve a smaller sum.

Now, Chef has a range [L,R][L,R], and he wants to calculate the sum of scores of all pairs of integers in this range ― formally, ∑Ri=L∑Rj=Lscore(i,j)∑i=LR∑j=LRscore(i,j). Since he is very busy with all his problem cooking, he asks you to write a program that would compute this sum. Since it could be very large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of scores modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.
