You are given an integer KK and a tree of size NN, rooted at node 11. In one operation, you can either select a node of the tree and color its entire subtree or create a new (uncolored) copy of the given tree. Find the minimum number of operations required so that the total number of colored nodes among all trees is exactly KK.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. Then TT test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers NN and KK, the size of the given tree and the number of nodes to be colored, respectively.
The next line contains N−1N−1 integers p2,…,pnp2,…,pn, where pipi is the parent of node ii.

Output
For each testcase, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to color exactly KK total nodes.

Explanation
For the first test case:

Operation 11: The subtree of node 11 is colored (coloring a total of 33 nodes).
Operation 22: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation 33: The subtree of node 22 of the new tree is colored.
Operation 44: The subtree of node 33 of the new tree is colored.

For the second test case:

Operation 11: The subtree of node 22 is colored (coloring a total of 33 nodes).
Operation 22: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation 33: The subtree of node 22 is colored (coloring a total of 33 more nodes).
