There are NN points in a plane (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the coordinates of the ii-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi). No three of these points are collinear. Let's denote a line segment between points uu and vv by (u,v)(u,v).
You are given a Delaunay triangulation of those points, which consists of MM triangles (numbered 11 through MM). For each valid ii, the vertices of the ii-th triangle are the points Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3.
You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Flip diagonal segment (u,v)(u,v): If there is a convex quadrilateral that contains this segment as a diagonal and does not contain any points other than its vertices, erase this segment and draw a new segment corresponding to the other diagonal of this quadrilateral. (Note that some segments cannot be flipped. It can be proved that if such a quadrilateral exists, it is unique and the result is also a triangulation.)

Then, you should perform the following operation some number of times:

Remove a segment (u,v)(u,v) that is shared by two regions with finite areas. When it is removed, the number of regions decreases by one.

A region is defined as a maximal set in the plane such that it does not contain any of the given points or currently existing segments and it is possible to move from each point in this set to any other point in this set without crossing any edge. Note that a region is not necessarily convex. Two regions share a line segment if it is possible to move from one of these regions to the other one by crossing only this segment.
After performing all operations, there must be exactly RR regions with finite areas. Let A1,A2,‚Ä¶,ARA1,A2,‚Ä¶,AR be these areas sorted in non-decreasing order. You are given the desired areas B1,B2,‚Ä¶,BRB1,B2,‚Ä¶,BR of the regions, also sorted in non-decreasing order. Your goal is to make ‚àëRi=1|Bi‚àí2‚ãÖAi|‚àëi=1R|Bi‚àí2‚ãÖAi| as small as possible by performing operations. However, you may only perform up to 1,0241,024 operations of the first type; note that the number of operations of the second type must always be M‚àíRM‚àíR.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and RR.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.
MM more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Pi,1Pi,1, Pi,2Pi,2 and Pi,3Pi,3.
The last line contains RR space-separated integers B1,B2,‚Ä¶,BRB1,B2,‚Ä¶,BR.

Output

First, print a line containing a single integer FF (F‚â§1024F‚â§1024) denoting the number of operations of the first type.
Then, print FF lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that you want to flip a diagonal segment (u,v)(u,v).
Finally, print M‚àíRM‚àíR lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that you want to remove a segment (u,v)(u,v).

Explanation
The initial triangulation is

After flipping edges ùñ•ùñßFH and ùñ°ùñ§BE, we obtain

After removing edges ùñ°ùñ•BF and ùñ•ùñ¶FG, we obtain

With this sequence of operations, we get the minimum possible score 00.
Test Generation
The source code in C++ used to generate test data can be downloaded here. The generator may crash with some seeds, run it multiple times until it generates the test files.

N=1,024N=1,024
the coordinates of each point are chosen uniformly randomly between 00 and 105105 inclusive, in such a way that no three points are collinear
a Delaunay triangulation is calculated; this is the triangulation given on the input
a parameter FF is chosen from the set {0,64,256}{0,64,256}
then, FF times, a diagonal segment is chosen uniformly randomly among segments in the Delaunay triangulation, and this segment is flipped
let VV be the set of diagonal segments that can be removed from the triangulation after performing the flips.
a parameter SS is chosen from the set {64,128,256,512}{64,128,256,512}
then, SS uniformly randomly edges are chosen from VV and removed from the triangulation. If is not possible to remove all the SS edges, then the process is repeated.
R=M‚àíSR=M‚àíS is the number of resulting regions with finite areas after removing the edges
for each of these regions, its area is calculated and multiplied by 22 (the resulting value is always an integer); B1,B2,‚Ä¶,BRB1,B2,‚Ä¶,BR are these values sorted in non-decreasing order

There is one test file for each possible combination of the parameters FF and SS.
Scoring
If your output is invalid (in particular, if you try to flip a non-diagonal segment, or to remove an edge that is not between two regions with finite areas, or to perform too many flips), you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
The score for each test case (and therefore each test file) is 108+‚àëRi=1|Bi‚àí2‚ãÖAi|108+‚àëi=1R|Bi‚àí2‚ãÖAi|. The score of a submission is equal to the sum of its scores over all test cases. Your goal is to minimise the score of your submission.
There are 12 test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly 6 test files, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 50% (6/12) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other six test files.
