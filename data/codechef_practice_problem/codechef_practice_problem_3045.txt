A bracket sequence is made up of brackets '(' and ')'. We define a balanced bracket sequence as following:

Empty sequence is balanced
If PP is balanced, (P)(P) is also balanced
If PP and QQ are balanced, PQPQ is also balanced

For example, empty sequence and sequences (())()(())(), ()(), (()(()))(()(())) are balanced. While ((, )()(, (()(() and (()))((()))( are not balanced. 
You are given a bracket sequence AA of length NN and QQ queries of the following form:
LL RR : You are given two integers LL and RR (1≤L≤R≤N)(1≤L≤R≤N). Find the number of pairs (X,Y)(X,Y), where L≤X≤Y≤RL≤X≤Y≤R, such that after removing the substring A[X,Y]A[X,Y] from A[L,R]A[L,R],  the substring A[L,R]A[L,R] becomes a balanced bracket sequence. 
In other words, for a given (L,R)(L,R), find the number of pairs (X,Y)(X,Y), such that the sequence AL…AX−1AY+1…ARAL…AX−1AY+1…AR is a balanced bracket sequence.
Note that, A[L,R]A[L,R] denotes the substring ALAL+1AL+2…AR−1ARALAL+1AL+2…AR−1AR.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains 22 integers NN and QQ - the size of the bracket sequence and the number of queries.
The second line contains a string AA of length NN - the bracket sequence.
The next QQ lines, each contain two integers LiLi and RiRi - the queries to be answered.

Output Format
Print QQ lines, representing the answer for each query.

Explanation

The first query is (()((()(. The only valid removal is (()(. Thus, answer for this query is 11.
The second query is )()((())()(((). The valid removals are )()((() and )()((().
The third query is (()((). The valid removals are ((), (() and (().

Explanation

The first query is the whole string. 

Some examples of valid removals in the first query are (())()()() and (())()()(). Total number of valid removals in this case is 2020.
