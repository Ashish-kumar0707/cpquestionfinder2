You and Paolo are playing a game.
Paolo, without letting you peek, writes down on a sheet of paper an N×NN×N matrix of 00s and 11s (all the N2N2 entries are either 00 or 11) such that, for each 1≤k≤N1≤k≤N, there is a row with exactly kk ones. In all tests, N=50N=50.
Your goal is to find the row with exactly ⌊N2⌋⌊N2⌋ ones.
In order to do it, you may ask the following kind of question to Paolo:  Paolo, what's the value in the ii-th row and jj-th column? 
The question is valid if 1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N.
You have to play T=500T=500 games and, in total, you can ask at most 610T610T questions.
Interaction Format
First, read two integers TT (T=500T=500) and NN (N=50N=50). They are fixed but still provided, just for your comfort.
Now, you start playing games. As soon as you give the answer to a game you should immediately start playing the next one.
To ask a question (of the kind described in the statement), you should print '? ii jj' (without quotes). After this, you should read an integer, the value of the entry in the ii-th row and jj-th column. A question is valid if 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N and 1≤j≤N1≤j≤N.
When you have identified the row with exactly ⌊N2⌋⌊N2⌋ ones, you should print '! ii' (without quotes), where ii is the index of the row (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N).
If you perform a malformed query, or you identify a row that does not have ⌊N2⌋⌊N2⌋ ones, the interactor terminates immediately and your program receives verdict Wrong Answer. If you ask more than 610T610T questions, the interaction continues until you have played all the games and then your program receives a verdict Wrong Answer.
A program in C++ which uses cin and cout (and flushes the output after every question) needs ≈700≈700ms to perform 610T=305000610T=305000 questions (considering only the time spent interacting).
The interactor is not adaptive (i.e., the TT matrices are chosen before the beginning of the interaction).
Note
Instead of providing a sample case that shows the interaction, we provide an implementation in C++  of a program that performs the interaction correctly and answers correctly (but it makes too many questions and therefore receives a verdict Wrong Answer).
Constraints
