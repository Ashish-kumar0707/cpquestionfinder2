Chef is viewing a simulation of creating a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) which calculates mysterious coefficients for all the edges. Initially, there is a graph without edges, but there is a set SS containing N−1N−1 edges (numbered 11 through N−1N−1) which should get added to the graph one by one.
In this process, N−1N−1 times, the following steps are performed:

An edge ee is chosen uniformly randomly from the current set SS.
This edge is added to the graph and removed from SS.
The coefficient of ee is set to the number of vertices in the connected component created by adding this edge.

Chef is wondering about the expected values of coefficients of the edges. Unfortunately, he does not have much time for such matters since he needs to prepare a superb cake for Chefina's birthday tomorrow.
Help Chef and for each edge, calculate the expected value of its coefficient modulo 998,244,353998,244,353. We can prove that each coefficient is a rational number; for a coefficient in the form P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353, you should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q−1Q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The following N−1N−1 lines describe the edges in SS. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that the ii-th edge connects vertices uu and vv.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N−1N−1 integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be R⋅Q−1R⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 for the coefficient of the ii-th edge.

Explanation
Example case 1:

With probability 1/21/2, the edge (1,2)(1,2) is added to the graph first and its coefficient is set to 22 (vertices 11 and 22 are in the connected component). Then, with probability 11, the edge (2,3)(2,3) is added and its coefficient is set to 33.
With probability 1/21/2, the edge (2,3)(2,3) is chosen first instead and its coefficient is set to 22. In this case, the coefficient of (1,2)(1,2) is then set to 33.

The expected value of the coefficient of the first edge is 2⋅1/2+3⋅1/2=5/22⋅1/2+3⋅1/2=5/2. For the second edge, it is the same.
Example case 2: The expected values of the coefficients are 17/6,3,17/617/6,3,17/6.
