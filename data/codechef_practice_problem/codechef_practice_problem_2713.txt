You are given a tree of NN nodes rooted at node 11. Each node uu initially has a positive value auau associated with it.
You randomly choose one node in the tree and change its value to zero. If any node uu has a value equal to 00, a random node vv will be chosen in the subtree of uu (u≠vu≠v), and the values auau and avav will be swapped, hence the value of the node vv will become zero and the process will continue until the zero is on a leaf node. At this point, we will call the tree a final tree.
Note: there is exactly one node with a value equal to zero in a final tree and that node is a leaf node.
Your task is to tell how many different final trees are possible. Two final trees are different if there exists at least one node uu, such that the value of the node uu in one final tree differs from the value of the node uu in the other final tree. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the number of nodes.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two integers uu and vv, denoting that there is an undirected edge between the node uu and the node vv.
The next line contains NN integers a1,…,aNa1,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, output on a new line, number of different final trees possible, modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation

For the first test case, the only possible final tree is when node 11 is chosen and its value becomes 0.
For the second test case, the four possible final trees are:

[ 1, 1, 1, 0 ]
[ 1, 1, 0, 2 ]
[ 1, 2, 1, 0 ]
[ 2, 1, 1, 0 ]
( The ii-th number in the array denotes the value of node ii in the final tree).
