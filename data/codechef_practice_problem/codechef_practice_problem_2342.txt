This is an interactive task
You are given a positive integer NN. There is a tree with NN nodes numbered from 11 to NN which is hidden from you.
You can ask queries of the following format:
?? kk a1a1 a2a2 a3a3 …ak…ak 
where:

3≤k≤N3≤k≤N
1≤ai≤N1≤ai≤N
ai≠ajai≠aj for all 1≤i<j≤k1≤i<j≤k

The judge will return 11 if {a1,a2,a3,…,aka1,a2,a3,…,ak}  is a subsequence of PP where PP is some simple path of the tree, else it will return 00. Refer to the Sample Interaction section below for a better understanding.
You need to print all the edges of the tree (in any order). You are allowed to ask at most N2N2 queries.
Interaction

Begin the interaction by reading a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.
For each test case, first read a single integer NN denoting the number of nodes in the tree. After this, you can start making queries.
To ask a query, output ?? kk a1a1 a2a2 a3a3 …ak…ak then read a single integer 00 or 11. 
To output the answer, output !, and then in the next N−1N−1 lines describe the edges of the tree. You can print the edges in any order.
If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
3≤N≤1003≤N≤100
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 100100

Explanation

Test case 11: The tree has the following edges (1,2),(2,3)(1,2),(2,3).

The query ? 3 2 1 3  returns 00 as it is not a subsequence of any simple path.
The query ? 3 3 2 1  returns 11 as it is a subsequence of the path {3,2,1}{3,2,1}.
Test case 22: The tree has the following edges (1,2),(2,4),(2,5),(1,3)(1,2),(2,4),(2,5),(1,3).

The query ? 3 5 1 3  returns 11 as it is a subsequence of the path {5,2,1,3}{5,2,1,3}.
The query ? 4 3 1 2 4  returns 11 as it is a subsequence of the path {3,1,2,4}{3,1,2,4}.
The query ? 4 5 1 2 4  returns 00 as it is not a subsequence of any simple path.

NOTE: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.
