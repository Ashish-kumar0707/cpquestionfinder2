You are given a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). The tree is rooted at node rr. For each node, find the number of walks with length KK from the root to this node modulo 998244353998244353.
A walk from node aa to node bb with length KK is defined as a sequence of nodes (u1,u2,…,uK+1)(u1,u2,…,uK+1), where u1=a,uK+1=bu1=a,uK+1=b and for each valid ii, there is an edge between nodes uiui and ui+1ui+1. Two walks (u1,u2,…,uK+1)(u1,u2,…,uK+1) and (v1,v2,…,vK+1)(v1,v2,…,vK+1) are considered different if there is a valid index ii such that ui≠viui≠vi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy denoting an edge between nodes xx and yy.
The last line contains two space-separated integers rr and KK.

Output
Print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of them should denote the number of walks from node rr to node ii with length KK, modulo 998244353998244353.

Explanation
There are three walks from node 33 to itself: (3,1,2,1,3)(3,1,2,1,3), (3,1,3,1,3)(3,1,3,1,3) and (3,1,4,1,3)(3,1,4,1,3).
