You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You have to answer QQ queries.
In each query, you are given two integers LL and RR, and you have to find the number of ordered pairs (X,Y)(X,Y) such that L≤X,Y≤RL≤X,Y≤R and AX≤AX⊕AY≤AYAX≤AX⊕AY≤AY. Here, ⊕⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
