Recently, Chef found a new formula for computing powers of a sequence:

You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and (l1,r1),(l2,r2),…,(lN,rN)(l1,r1),(l2,r2),…,(lN,rN).
The 1-st power of the sequence A is A1=A.
For each k>1, the k-th power of the sequence A (denoted by Ak) is a sequence with length N such that for each valid i, the i-th element of this sequence is (Ak)i=(Ak−1)li⊕(Ak−1)li+1⊕…⊕(Ak−1)ri−1⊕(Ak−1)ri.

After discovering this new formula, Chef tried to find AK, but he felt that it is very time consuming. Therefore, Chef wants you to do it. Can you find the K-th power of A for Chef?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers (AK)1,(AK)2,…,(AK)N.
