There is a full-scale war taking place in Treeland. Chef needs to travel between cities in Treeland to work, but during the war, it is not safe.
In Treeland, there are NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) and N−1N−1 bidirectional roads connecting them in such a way that Chef can reach each city from any other city using these roads. Each road is occupied by a unique faction that assigned a positive integer code to it.
Let f(A,B)f(A,B) denote the greatest positive integer which divides the code of each road on the shortest path between cities AA and BB (the GCD of these codes). If Chef wants to go from city AA to city BB safely, he needs to pay f(A,B)f(A,B) units of money.
Since Chef is not sure between which pairs of cities he is going to travel, he wants to know
S=∑i=1N∑j=i+1Nf(i,j).S=∑i=1N∑j=i+1Nf(i,j).
Help Chef calculate SS.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers XX, YY and ZZ denoting that cities XX and YY are connected by a road with code ZZ.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer SS.
