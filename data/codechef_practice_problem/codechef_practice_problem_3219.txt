You are given an array AA of NN positive integers. You are allowed to perform any of the following operations any number of times:

Pick an index ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and a prime number pp. Assign Ai×pAi×p to AiAi.
Pick an index ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and a prime number pp such that AiAi is divisible by pp. Assign Ai÷pAi÷p to aiai.

The goal is to make all the numbers in array equal using the minimum number of operations. Among all sequences of operations using the minimum number of operations, denote SS to be the smallest final value of all elements in AA. You are given QQ queries of the form (Li,Ri)(Li,Ri). For each query, you need to calculate the SS value of the contiguous subarray ALi…RiALi…Ri.
Input Format

The first line contains NN and QQ denoting the number of elements in the array and number of queries.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN denoting the given array.
QQ lines follow. The ii-th line contains two space-separated integers LiLi and RiRi denoting the ii-th query.

Output Format
For each query, output the value SS for the subarray on a single line.

Explanation

For the first query, there is only one sequence of operations that uses 22 operations:

Choose i=2i=2 and p=11p=11, assign A2×11=77A2×11=77 to A2A2.
Choose i=3i=3 and p=7p=7, assign A3×7=77A3×7=77 to A3A3.

We can prove that there aren't any sequence of operations that uses 11 operation, so the above sequence uses the least number of operations. The final SS value is 7777.

For the second query, there are two sequences of operations that uses 22 operations. Those are:

Choose i=3i=3 and p=7p=7, assign A3×7=77A3×7=77 to A3A3.
Choose i=4i=4 and p=7p=7, assign A4÷7=11A4÷7=11 to A4A4.

Both of them are optimal in terms of number of operations. The first sequence of operations has the final value SS to be 7777, and the second sequence of operations has the final value SS to be 1111. Therefore, the answer to this query is 1111 (we need to minimize the final value SS).
