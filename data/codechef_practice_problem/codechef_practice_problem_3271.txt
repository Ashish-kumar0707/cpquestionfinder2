You are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). Node 11 is the root. You are also given integer sequences x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN and v1,v2,…,vNv1,v2,…,vN.
Let SS be a subset of nodes. It is called valid if it is non-empty and the following conditions hold:

There is no pair of nodes (i,j)(i,j) such that i,j∈Si,j∈S and ii is an ancestor of jj.
The greatest common divisor of the values xixi for all nodes i∈Si∈S (let's denote it by GG) is greater than 11.

Next, let's define the value of SS as G⋅VG⋅V, where GG is defined above and V=∑i∈SviV=∑i∈Svi.
You need to find a valid subset of nodes with the maximum value.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that nodes uu and vv are connected by an edge.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and vivi.

Output
For each test case, print three lines.

The first of these lines should contain two space-separated integers G⋅VG⋅V and GG for your chosen subset.
The second line should contain a single integer KK ― the size of your subset.
The third line should contain KK space-separated integers ― the numbers of the nodes in this subset (in any order).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
