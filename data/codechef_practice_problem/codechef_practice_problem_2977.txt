Joshua is hiding a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, where NN is even. He wants to play a game with you. Your goal is to guess the sequence.
First, Joshua tells you A1A1 and ANAN. Then, you should ask him queries. In each query, you choose four integers L1L1, R1R1, L2L2 and R2R2 such that 1≤L1<R1≤N1≤L1<R1≤N and 1≤L2<R2≤N1≤L2<R2≤N, and Joshua's answer is the maximum of AL1,AL1+1,…,AR1AL1,AL1+1,…,AR1 minus the minimum of AL2,AL2+1,…,AR2AL2,AL2+1,…,AR2.
Can you find the sequence using no more than 2N2N queries?
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers NN, A1A1 and ANAN.
Then you may ask queries. To ask a query:
Print a line containing the character 'Q' followed by a space and four space-separated integers L1L1, R1R1, L2L2 and R2R2.
Then, read a line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.
When you think you know the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!' followed by a space and NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN describing your guess.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤109 for each valid ii

Example
You                         Grader
                            4 1 1
Q 1 2 3 4
                            1
Q 3 4 1 3
                            2
! 1 2 3 1

Explanation
Joshua has the sequence [1,2,3,1][1,2,3,1].
For the first query, the maximum of A1,A2A1,A2 is 22 and the minimum of A3,A4A3,A4 is 11, so the answer to this query is 2−1=12−1=1.
For the second query, the maximum of A3,A4A3,A4 is 33 and the minimum of A1,A3A1,A3 is 11, so the answer is 3−1=23−1=2.
Finally, we correctly guess the sequence by printing "! 1 2 3 1".
