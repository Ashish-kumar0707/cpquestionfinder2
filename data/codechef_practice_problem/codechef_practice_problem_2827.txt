Chef is playing a game, which he starts with a score of S=0S=0. He also has an integer NN.
In one move, Chef does the following:

Uniformly randomly pick an integer XX between 00 and 2N−12N−1 (inclusive of both ends)
Update his score as S→S∣XS→S∣X, where ∣∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation

For example, if Chef's current score is S=6S=6 and he picks X=10X=10, his new score is 6∣10=146∣10=14.
Chef stops when his score SS becomes equal to 2N−12N−1.  What is the expected number of moves Chef performs?
Output the answer modulo 109+7109+7. That is, the answer can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/Q, where gcd(Q,109+7)=1gcd(Q,109+7)=1. Print P⋅Q−1(mod 109+7)P⋅Q−1(mod 109+7), where Q−1Q−1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of QQ with respect to 109+7109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the expected number of moves Chef performs, modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Test case 11: In each move, Chef chooses either 00 or 11, each with a probability of 1/21/2. The game ends as soon as Chef chooses 11. Thus, the probability that the game takes exactly kk moves is 2−k2−k.
The required expected value is then ∑k=1∞k⋅2−k∑k=1∞k⋅2−k, which equals 22. 
Test case 22: In each move, Chef chooses an integer in [0,3][0,3]. The answer is 8/38/3.
