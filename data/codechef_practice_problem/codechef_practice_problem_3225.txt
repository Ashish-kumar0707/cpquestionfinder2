Consider a string ss. The following operation can be performed on it successively several (possibly zero) times. 

Select any non empty suffix of ss and append it to ss

For example, if s=abcds=abcd, then ss can become either abcddabcdd, abcdcdabcdcd, abcdbcdabcdbcd or abcdabcdabcdabcd after one operation. Successive operations are now performed on the new string.
You are given a string tt, the resultant string after applying several (possibly zero) operations on some string. You must find any such string ss of the shortest length from which tt can be obtained after some sequence of operations. It can be proven that such a string always exists.
Input Format

The first line contains one number TT, the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains the string tt.

Output Format
For each test case print a string ss of the shortest possible length which satisfies the requirements. If there are multiple such strings, you may print any.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤|t|≤2⋅1051≤|t|≤2⋅105
String tt contains only lowercase english alphabets.
The total length of all the strings in the input is at most 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 11: String abab satisfies the requirements.
abab →→ abbabb →→ abbabbabbabb →→ abbabbbabbabbabbbabb
No string of length less than 22 exists from which abbabbbabbabbabbbabb can be obtained after some operations.
Test case 22: String abab satisfies the requirements.
abab →→ abbabb →→ abbbabbb →→ abbbabbbabbbabbb →→ abbbabbbbabbbabbbb
Test case 33: String codechefcodechef satisfies the requirements.
