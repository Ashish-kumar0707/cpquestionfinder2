Utkarsh is forced to play another game with Ashish.
In this game there are NN piles, ithith pile contains AiAi stones. Utkarsh moves first.
In his turn a player can choose any pile with non-zero stones and remove exactly one stone from that pile. The game ends when there is exactly one pile containing non-zero stones and the player who made the last move wins the game.
Now you are given an array BB of length NN. Utkarsh wants to know for how many arrays A such that 1≤Ai≤Bi1≤Ai≤Bi for every ii, he will win the game assuming that both players play optimally.
Since the answer can be large output it modulo 998244353998244353. 
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case consists of an integer NN.
Second line consists of NN space separated integers denoting the array BB.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of games Utkarsh wins modulo 998244353998244353.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
2≤N≤5002≤N≤500
1≤Bi≤1091≤Bi≤109
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 500500

Explanation

For the first test case, Utkarsh wins the game for following arrays:

[1,1][1,1], [1,2][1,2], [1,3][1,3], [2,1][2,1], [3,1][3,1], [2,3][2,3], [3,2][3,2].
So there are total 77 possibilities.
