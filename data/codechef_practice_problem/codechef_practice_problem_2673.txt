Shamili has an array A=[A0,A1,…,AN−1]A=[A0,A1,…,AN−1] of length NN. She painted each element of this array in either Black or White. 
She allows you to right rotate the values in array AA by any value kk. In other words, let BB be the resulting array after right rotating AA by kk, then Bi=A(i−k+n)(modN)Bi=A(i−k+n)(modN) where B0B0 and A0A0 are the first elements in the arrays AA and BB respectively). Note that when you rotate the array AA, their colors won't get rotated and only the values in it get rotated. For example, let the array AA be [3,2,7,6][3,2,7,6] and their colors be [[Black, Black, White, White]]. Right rotating AA by 22 will give you the array [7,6,3,2][7,6,3,2] with colors [[Black, Black, White, White]].
Let maxbmaxb be the maximum value among all the elements that are painted in Black and minwminw be the minimum value among all the elements that are painted in White. Shamili asked you to find the maximum value of maxb−minwmaxb−minw after right rotating the array aa at most once.
It is guaranteed that at least one element in the array is colored in Black and at least one element is colored in White.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases. TT test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains the integer NN.
The second line contains NN integers A0,A1,A2,...,AN−1A0,A1,A2,...,AN−1. Note that AA is 0-indexed.
The third line of each test case contains a string CC of size NN representing the color of each element. (Ci=‘B‘Ci=‘B‘ if the ithith element in array AA is painted in Black color and Ci=‘W‘Ci=‘W‘ if the ithith element is painted in White color). Note that CC is also 0-indexed, i.e. the first character of CC is C0C0 and the last character is CN−1CN−1.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of maxb−minwmaxb−minw.

Explanation

Test case 11: When we right rotate the array by 11, the resulting array will be [6,5,1,2][6,5,1,2]. Now the maximum value in Black elements is 66 (maxbmaxb) and minimum value in White elements (minwminw) is 22. Therefore, the answer will be 6−2=46−2=4. It can be shown that this is the maximum result possible.
Test case 22: We can convert the given array to [9,3,1,8,2][9,3,1,8,2]. So, the maximum value is 9−1=89−1=8.
