You have to process QQ queries on a rooted tree. Each node of the tree has a label and a color. Initially, the tree consists of a single node (the root) with label 11 and color c0c0. There are two types of queries:

You are given an existing node uu and a color cc. Let's denote the number of nodes in the tree before this query by kk. Create a node with label k+1k+1 and color cc, and add it to the tree as a child of node uu.
You are given a node uu and a color cc. For each node with color cc (possibly including uu), find its distance from node uu. The answer to this query is the minimum of these distances, or −1−1 if there are no nodes with color cc in the tree.

The input is encoded so that you have to process these queries online.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers QQ and c0c0.
Each of the following QQ lines contains a character tt followed by a space and two space-separated integers u′u′ and c′c′ describing a query.
The character tt is '+' for a query of the first type or '?' for a query of the second type.
Let's denote the answer to the last query of the second type by aa (a=−1a=−1 if there have been no queries of the second type so far). The parameters uu and cc of the current query can be computed as u=u′⊕(a+1)u=u′⊕(a+1) and c=c′⊕(a+1)c=c′⊕(a+1).

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to this query.

tt is '+' or '?'
