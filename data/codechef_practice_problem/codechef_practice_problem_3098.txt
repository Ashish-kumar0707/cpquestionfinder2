It's Valentine's Month, and so Chef wants to gift a string to Chefina. He knows that Chefina likes palindromic strings. Chef has a string SS consisting of digits from 00 to 99. He wants to convert this to a palindrome by performing zero or more operations, where an operation is defined as follows:

Pick any digit and replace all of its occurrences with any other digit.

For example, if S=12123S=12123, in one move it can be turned into 1414314143 or 1212812128, but not 3212332123.
You are also given NN integers cost1,cost2,…,costNcost1,cost2,…,costN, where the cost of performing an operation that replaces XX characters is costXcostX.
Your task is to help Chef minimize the cost of converting his string to a palindrome.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of 33 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, denoting the length of the string.
The second line of each test case contains a string of length NN, consisting of only the digits 00 to 99.
The third line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers, denoting the cost array.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the minimum cost to convert the string to a palindrome.

Explanation
Test case 11: Replace all occurrences of 77 with 22 and then replace all occurrences of 22 with 55, making the final string 55555555. The cost of doing this is 1+4=51+4=5.
Test case 22: The cost is 00 since the given string is already a palindrome.
Test case 33: We perform the following operations:

Replace 22 with 00 with a cost of 11.
Replace 00 with 33 with a cost of 33.
Replace 33 with 44 with a cost of 22.
Replace 44 with 77 with a cost of 11.

Therefore, the total cost is 1+3+2+1=71+3+2+1=7.
Test case 44: We can replace all occurrences of 11 with 22, incurring a total cost of 33.
In all the examples above, it can be shown that it is not possible to convert the string to a palindrome at a lower cost.
