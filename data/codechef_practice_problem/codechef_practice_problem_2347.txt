Chef is preparing a brand new dish. He found NN new ingredients (numbered 11 through NN) for the dish. For each valid ii, the ii-th ingredient costs CiCi dollars and it has value ViVi.
Chef has a budget: SS dollars. He can buy each ingredient at most once. A non-empty subset of these NN ingredients (possibly containing all ingredients) is called affordable if the sum of costs of all the ingredients in the subset does not exceed Chef's budget. The tastiness of a dish prepared using a set of ingredients is equal to vKvK, where vv is the sum of values of all the ingredients in the set and KK is a fixed integer.
To make a dish, Chef should use an affordable subset of ingredients. He wants to try out all the dishes he can make. Find the total (summed up) tastiness of all these dishes. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, SS and KK.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers CiCi and ViVi.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the total tastiness modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.

Explanation
Chef can make dishes using the following subsets of ingredients:

{1}{1} with tastiness 22=422=4
{2}{2} with tastiness 32=932=9
{3}{3} with tastiness 42=1642=16
{1,3}{1,3} with total value 62=3662=36

The subsets {1,2}{1,2}, {2,3}{2,3} and {1,2,3}{1,2,3} cannot be used because they are not affordable.
