You are given a permutation PP of length NN. You can perform the following operation on PP:

Choose any ii and jj such that i<ji<j and Pi<PjPi<Pj, and remove exactly one of them from the array. After removing, the remaining parts of the array are concatenated.

Find out if it is possible to apply the given operation any number of times such that only one element remains in the array.
Note: A permutation of length NN is an array where every element from 11 to NN occurs exactly once.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains NN - the length of the permutation PP.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN - elements of the permutation.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to reduce the array to a single element using the given operation. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

Explanation

Test case 11: We can apply operations as follows (the bolded elements are the pair chosen for that operation): [3,1,2,4]→[1,2,4]→[2,4]→[4][3,1,2,4]→[1,2,4]→[2,4]→[4]
Test case 22: It can be shown that it is not possible to remove all elements except one element from the array.
Test case 33: We can apply operations as follows: [5,2,3,6,1,4]→[2,3,6,1,4]→[2,3,1,4]→[3,1,4]→[1,4]→[4][5,2,3,6,1,4]→[2,3,6,1,4]→[2,3,1,4]→[3,1,4]→[1,4]→[4]
