While Kim notes down the different base plans possible, Soum pulls a lever from the control room, and Kim falls into a trapped cell! Has the JSA won the battle?
Unfortunately for the JSA, Kim is a genius, so he has obviously easily escaped from his cell. However, he found that his cell is only one in a large underground network of cells. Now he needs to find a way to escape!
Of course, since it is a prison, some of the cells are locked at all times. However, some prison guards are lazy and left the keys for a cell in another cell. Each key can only unlock one cell and each cell can only be unlocked by one key. If any cell does not have a corresponding key, it is unlocked.
The prison consists of NN cells labelled 1 to NN with cell 1 being Kim's starting position and cell NN being the exit of the underground prison network. Furthermore, there are EE bidirectional connections between cells. The ii-th connection takes Kim CiCi seconds to pass through, and connects cells AiAi and BiBi. Kim takes no time to pick up a key when he reaches a cell containing a key, and takes no time to unlock a door with a key. Cells 1 and NN never have any keys in them. Additionally, no two keys will ever be found in the same cell.
Can you help Kim find the minimum time it would take him to go from cell 1 to cell NN?
Input:
The first line of input contains 3 integers NN, EE and KK denoting the number of cells, number of connections and the number of keys.
The following EE lines contain 3 integers, AiAi, BiBi and CiCi showing that a connection exists between cell AiAi and BiBi taking CiCi time to traverse.
The following KK lines contain 2 integers, LL and UU denoting that the key for cell UU is located at cell LL.
Output:
Print one number SS which is the time from cell 1 to cell NN. If this is not possible print -1.
The answer is guaranteed to fit into a 64 bit integer.
Subtasks
For all subtasks, 5≤N≤1000005≤N≤100000, 4≤E≤2000004≤E≤200000, 0≤K≤120≤K≤12. For all edges, 1≤A,B≤N1≤A,B≤N, 1≤C≤1091≤C≤109. All key nodes and lock nodes are distinct. No cell contains both a key and a lock, and no cell contains more than one key or more than one lock. In addition, cells 11 and NN will never have a key or lock. Connections may connect a node to itself, and multiple connections may exist between two nodes.
