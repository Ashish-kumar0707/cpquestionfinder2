After solving the 64√ó64√ó6464√ó64√ó64 Rubik's cube, Chef Ada moved to arts.
For her next masterpiece, Ada drew an abstract painting as follows:

NN points (numbered 11 through NN) are painted on a 2D canvas. Some of these points are red ('R'), some are blue ('B') and the rest are green ('G'). No three points are collinear.
A triangulation, i.e. a maximum set of non-intersecting triangles such that the vertices of each triangle are three of the points painted in the previous step, is drawn on the canvas. The edges of the triangles are black and the colours of the points are unaffected by this. Triangles may share edges or vertices, only intersections with positive area are not allowed.

Ada is not satisfied with her painting, so she wants to modify it a bit using the following operations:

Change the colour of a point. The cost of this operation is XX.
Flip one edge: if there is a convex quadrilateral which contains this edge as a diagonal, erase this edge and draw a new edge corresponding to the other diagonal of this quadrilateral. (Note that some edges cannot be flipped. It can be proved that if such a quadrilateral exists, it is unique and the resulting drawing also corresponds to a triangulation.) The cost of this operation is YY.

The operations may be performed multiple times in any order. Let's denote the number of operations of the first type by CC and the number of operations of the second type by FF. Performing many operations could ruin the painting, though, so Ada wants to perform at most PP operations of the first type (C‚â§PC‚â§P) and at most QQ operations of the second type (F‚â§QF‚â§Q).
Ada thinks that a triangle is ugly if at least two of its vertices have the the same colour. Let UU be the number of ugly triangles after performing the operations. Help Ada choose the operations to perform in a way that minimises G=X‚ãÖC+Y‚ãÖF+U2G=X‚ãÖC+Y‚ãÖF+U2, where XX and YY are given coefficients.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM, where MM denotes the number of triangles in the original triangulation.
The second line contains four space-separated integers XX, YY, PP and QQ.
The third line contains a string SS with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS denotes the colour of the ii-th point.
For each valid ii, the ii-th of the next NN lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi denoting the coordinates of the ii-th point.
For each valid ii, the ii-th of the last MM lines contains three space-separated integers aiai, bibi and cici denoting the points that are vertices of the ii-th triangle.

Output

First, print a line containing two space-separated integers CC and FF.
Then, print a line containing a string with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should denote the final colour of the ii-th point ('R', 'G' or 'B').
Finally, print FF lines describing the sequence of performed edge flips. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that the edge between points uu and vv should be flipped.

Explanation

After performing the operations, the ugly triangles are ‚ñ≥ùñ†ùñ°ùñ£‚ñ≥ABD, ‚ñ≥ùñ†ùñ¢ùñ¶‚ñ≥ACG and ‚ñ≥ùñ†ùñ¢ùñ•‚ñ≥ACF. Note that the edge ùñ†ùñ¢AC cannot be flipped to ùñ•ùñ¶FG because the quadrilateral ùñ†ùñ¶ùñ¢ùñ•AGCF is not convex.

Scoring
The score for each test case (and therefore each test file) is G=X‚ãÖC+Y‚ãÖF+U2G=X‚ãÖC+Y‚ãÖF+U2. The score of a submission is equal to the sum of its scores over all test cases. Your goal is to minimise the score of your submission.
There are ten test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly three test files, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 30% (3/10) of the test files; However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other seven test files.
Test generation
Each test is generated as follows:

NN points are chosen uniformly randomly in such a way that no three of them are collinear.
Each point is assigned a random colour: 'R', 'G' or 'B'.
A Delaunay triangulation is calculated.
A parameter KK is chosen manually.
A sequence of KK edge flips is performed. In each flip, the edge to flip is chosen uniformly randomly among all edges that can be flipped in the current triangulation.

There is one test file for each combination of the following parameters:

K=16K=16 or K=256K=256
P=N/2P=N/2
Q=210Q=210
(X,Y)=(10,160)(X,Y)=(10,160), (X,Y)=(20,80)(X,Y)=(20,80), (X,Y)=(40,40)(X,Y)=(40,40), (X,Y)=(80,20)(X,Y)=(80,20) or (X,Y)=(160,10)(X,Y)=(160,10)
