"Out of 6 billion humans, the troublemakers are just a handful." - Dalai Lama
Nikitasha and Mansi are best friends. They have a binary sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN (each element of this sequence is 00 or 11). Their friend Sakshi always finds ways to trouble them. This time, Sakshi altered their sequence by performing the following operation ZZ times:

Create a new sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. Initially, Ai=BiAi=Bi for each valid ii.
For each valid ii such that Ai=0Ai=0 and Ai+1=1Ai+1=1, swap BiBi and Bi+1Bi+1, i.e. set Bi=1Bi=1 and Bi+1=0Bi+1=0. Note that the order of swaps does not matter.
Replace the sequence AA by the sequence BB.

Now, Sakshi challenges Nikitasha And Mansi to find the altered sequence (the resulting sequence AA after ZZ steps). Help Nikitasha and Mansi find this sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and ZZ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers — the altered sequence.

Explanation
Example case 1: After the first step, the sequence becomes (1,0,1,1,0,1)(1,0,1,1,0,1). After the second step, it becomes (1,1,0,1,1,0)(1,1,0,1,1,0).
Example case 2: After the first step, the sequence becomes (1,0,1,0)(1,0,1,0). After the second step, the sequence becomes (1,1,0,0)(1,1,0,0). Applying more steps does not alter the sequence anymore, so after the third and fourth step, the sequence remains (1,1,0,0)(1,1,0,0).
