Chef and Chefina are playing a game.
Chef has NN monsters (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the ii-th monster has a value V1,iV1,i and it is either in attack mode or defense mode. The initial states of the monsters are described by a string D1D1: for each valid ii, the ii-th monster is in attack mode if the ii-th character of D1D1 is 'A' or in defense mode if the ii-th character is 'D'.
Chefina has MM monsters (numbered 11 through MM). Their values are V2,1,V2,2,…,V2,MV2,1,V2,2,…,V2,M and their initial states are described by a string D2D2 in the same way.
In the game, the players alternate turns; Chef plays first. During each turn, the current player may either end the game immediately or do the following: choose one of their own living monsters in attack mode, choose a monster of the other player in defense mode, attack and kill this defending monster and change the attacking monster to defense mode. Note that once a monster is in defense mode, it never changes to attack mode.
Each player is trying to maximise the difference X−YX−Y, where XX is the sum of values of this player's living monsters (in both modes, but only if they are alive) and YY is the sum of values of the opponent's living monsters. Assuming that both players are playing optimally, calculate the sum of values of Chef's living monsters minus the sum of values of Chefina's living monsters after the game ends.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers V1,1,V1,2,…,V1,NV1,1,V1,2,…,V1,N.
The third line contains a single string D1D1 with length NN.
The fourth line contains MM space-separated integers V2,1,V2,2,…,V2,MV2,1,V2,2,…,V2,M.
The fifth line contains a single string D2D2 with length MM.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of values of Chef's living monsters minus the sum of values of Chefina's living monsters after the game ends.
