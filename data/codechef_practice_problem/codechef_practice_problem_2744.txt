You are given a matrix CC that has NN rows and MM columns where each entry is 11 or 00 or ùö°x. Here ùö°x denotes a don't care value. 
You can perform the following operation on the matrix:

Pick any column jj such that 1‚â§j‚â§M1‚â§j‚â§M.
Assign Ci,j‚ÜíCi,j‚äï1Ci,j‚ÜíCi,j‚äï1 for all 1‚â§i‚â§N1‚â§i‚â§N

You are given that:

0‚äï1=10‚äï1=1
1‚äï1=01‚äï1=0
ùö°‚äï1=ùö°x‚äï1=x
where ‚äï‚äï denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

You have to perform any number of operations (possibly 00) such that each row in the matrix has at most a single 11.
Determine if it's possible to achieve this. Print YES if it's possible, else print NO.
Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case has two integers NN and MM - the number of rows and number of columns respectively.  
The next MM lines of the test case contain NN characters each where the jj-th character in the ii-th line denotes Ci,jCi,j.

Output Format
Print YES if it's possible to perform any number of operations so that each row has at most a single 11, else print NO.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).

Explanation

Test case-1: We just perform one operation on the first column.
Test case-2: We perform the operations on the columns 1,31,3 and 55.
Test case-3: It can be proven that it is impossible to satisfy the given conditions using any number of operations.
