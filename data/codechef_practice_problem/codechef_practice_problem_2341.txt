Kiteretsu goes to his Chemistry Lab to perform the perfect reaction.
In his lab, he found NN reagents numbered 11 to NN. The ithith reagent has two properties - AiAi and BiBi.
A reaction can be performed between the reagents ii and jj only if Ai≤jAi≤j.
If a reaction is performed between reagents ii and jj, i⋅ji⋅j amount of heat is produced. Out of this, D⋅(Bi⊕Bj)D⋅(Bi⊕Bj) is absorbed and the rest heat is released. Here, ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
More formally, in a reaction between reagents ii and jj, the heat released is given by:

H(i,j)=i⋅j−D⋅(Bi⊕Bj)H(i,j)=i⋅j−D⋅(Bi⊕Bj)

Find the maximum possible heat which can be released in a reaction.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains two integers N,DN,D.
Second line of each test case contains NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. 
Third line of each test case contains NN integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line, a single integer denoting the maximum possible heat that can be released in a reaction.

Explanation
Test Case 11: Let us choose i=2i=2 and j=4j=4. Since A2≤4A2≤4, a reaction can take place.
The heat released in this reaction is 2⋅4−2⋅(3⊕2)=8−2⋅1=62⋅4−2⋅(3⊕2)=8−2⋅1=6. It can be proven that for no other reaction, the heat released is greater than 66.
Some other reactions can take place between (2,5)(2,5), (3,5)(3,5). Note that no reaction is possible between (3,4)(3,4) as A3≰4A3≰4.
Test Case 22: The only possible reaction is between reagents 11 and 22. The heat released in this reaction is 1⋅2−3⋅(1⊕2)=2−3⋅3=−71⋅2−3⋅(1⊕2)=2−3⋅3=−7.
