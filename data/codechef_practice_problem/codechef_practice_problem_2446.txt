Chef is serving dishes at a feast full of colorblind people. He is adding dishes one by one to a long table to form a sequence of dishes; for each dish he adds, we know its color and deliciousness. A person with colorblindness cc can only see dishes with colors in the range [c−K,c+K][c−K,c+K].
You should process QQ queries. There are three types of queries:

1cd1cd: Chef adds a dish with color cc and deliciousness dd to the front of the sequence.
2cd2cd: Chef adds a dish with color cc and deliciousness dd to the back of the sequence.
3c3c: Consider a person with colorblindness cc. This person must choose an arbitrary contiguous subsequence of dishes on the table (possibly empty) and then eat all the dishes which this person can see. Chef wants to know the maximum possible total (summed up) deliciousness of the eaten dishes.

Note that all the people attending this feast are polite, so no dishes are actually eaten until Chef receives the answers to all of his queries. 
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers QQ and KK.
The following QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines starts with two space-separated integers bb and CC, where bb denotes the type of this query. If b=1b=1 or b=2b=2, they are followed by a space and an integer dd. The value of cc for this query is computed as c=C⊕ansc=C⊕ans, where ansans is the answer to the previous query of type 33 or 00 if there have not been any queries of type 33 so far.

Output
For each query of type 33, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum total deliciousness.
