Let AA be an array of NN elements and let us define beauty of array as (consider 1 based indexing)
long long int beauty(int N, int A[]){
     long long int val = 0;
     for(int i = 1; i < N; i++){
           for(int j = i + 1; j <= N; j++){
                 if(a[i] < a[j]){val++;}
                 else{val--;}
           }
     }
     return val;
}

Let GG be a tree with NN nodes numbered from 11 to NN rooted at node 11. Find the Expected Beauty of all the valid BFS(BreadthFirstSearch)BFS(BreadthFirstSearch) of GG.
Expected beauty of a BFSBFS can be calculated using above function considering visiting order as elements of the array.
Input:

First line will contain NN, the number of nodes. 
This will be followed by N−1N−1 lines each containing two space-separated integers aa, bb denoting that their is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output:

On a single line, print a real number, the answer to the problem. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6. Formally, if your answer is aa and the jury's answer is bb, your answer will be accepted if |a−b|max(1,b)≤10−6|a−b|max(1,b)≤10−6.

Constraints:

1≤N≤2∗1051≤N≤2∗105

Sample Input
3
1 2
1 3

Expected Output
2.000000
Explanation:
Valid BFSs are 1 2 3 — beauty = 33; and 1 3 2 — beauty = 11.
So, Expected Beauty is equal to 12∗3+12∗1=2.00012∗3+12∗1=2.000.
