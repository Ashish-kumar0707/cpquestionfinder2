Tsetso likes to play with arrays. 
An Array A[1,2,…,N]A[1,2,…,N] is said to be a Tsetso array if A[1]⋅A[N]=max(A1,A2,…,AN−1,AN)A[1]⋅A[N]=max(A1,A2,…,AN−1,AN).
Bedo, his teammate, likes to solve problems so much, so Tsetso gave him an array AA of NN distinctdistinct integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and QQ queries of the form [L,R][L,R] and asked him to count the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range.
A subarray[L,R][L,R] is to be a Tsetso subarray if A[L]⋅A[R]=max(AL,AL+1,....,AR−1,AR)A[L]⋅A[R]=max(AL,AL+1,....,AR−1,AR).
Bedo spent a lot of time trying to solve it, but he couldn't, can you?
NoteNote: A sequence aa is a subarray of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. 
Input Format

First-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ, the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.
The second line contains NN distinctdistinct space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Then QQ lines follow each line containing two space-separated integers L,RL,R. 

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line the number of Tsetso subarrays in the given range [L,R][L,R].

Explanation

All the valid subarrays are [1,6],[2,4],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5],[5,6],[4,7][1,6],[2,4],[3,5],[4,5],[5,5],[5,6],[4,7].
One of the invalid subarrays is [1,3],3⋅24≠max(3,6,24)[1,3],3⋅24≠max(3,6,24)
