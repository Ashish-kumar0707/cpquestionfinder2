Chef has a tree with N nodes numbered 1 through N.
A subset S of nodes of the tree is called connected if, for any two nodes from S, the simple path between these two nodes in the tree contains only nodes which belong to S.
Chef defines the cost of a connected subset S as |S| · AND(S). Here, |S| denotes the size of the set S and  AND(S) denotes the bitwise AND of indices of all nodes from S.
Chef would like to know the maximum of costs of all connected subsets. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the following N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y of the tree.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum cost of a connected subset.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
1 ≤ x, y ≤ N
1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases  ≤ 300,000
