Chef has a string SS. A substring of SS is obtained by removing zero or more characters from the beginning and/or end of SS. For each LL (1≤L≤|S|1≤L≤|S|):

KK times, Chef wants to choose a substring of SS with length LL uniformly randomly and independently.
Find the probability that all these KK substrings will be pairwise distinct. It can be proved that this probability can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ, where PP and QQ are integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q−1Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string SS followed by a space and an integer KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing |S||S| integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 for L=iL=i.
