Everybody is sad, most of all Monica as Chandler must spend Christmas and New Years in Tulsa, where his staff is all depressed they can't be with their families. He arranged for the head office to send a bonus, but even that's another bummer: donations in their name to the New York ballet. Chandler sends a message to the head office in the form of a binary code, which somehow gets changed on the way.
Chef is given two binary strings SS and TT of lengths NN and MM respectively. We can perform the following operations on string SS.

Select two adjacent characters of the string SS and flip these two characters. ( Flipping the character 11 is equivalent to replacing the character 11 with 00, and vice-versa )
Add a character, either 00 or 11 to any of the ends ( either the front or the back ) of the string SS.

Find the minimum number of operations needed to convert SS to TT. If it is impossible to convert SS to TT, print -1.
Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,MN,M.
Second line of each testcase contains a binary string SS.
Third line of each testcase contains a binary string TT.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum number of operations needed to convert SS to TT. If it is impossible to convert, print -1.
Constraints

1≤T≤201≤T≤20
1≤N,M≤10001≤N,M≤1000
S,TS,T contain 0,10,1 only.

                        Sample Output 1
                        





2
-1


Explanation
Test case 1: Flip the first two bits in one move and second two bits in second move. 101101 →→ 011011 →→ 000000.
Test case 2: It is impossible to convert SS to TT using any sequence of moves.
