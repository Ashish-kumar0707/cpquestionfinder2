Given an integer N, you can apply a operation on NN multiple times(possibly 0).        
Operation is defined as follows:    

Choose a positive integer KK such that KK has exactly 44 divisors and KK is a divisor of NN.    
Change NN to N/KN/K.         

Find the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number NN. 
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integers NN.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.

Explanation
Example case 1: We cannot divide N=3N=3 by any valid KK and hence output is 22 as N=3N=3 has exactly two divisors 11 and 33.  
Example case 2: N=64N=64 can be divided by 88 twice as 88 has exactly 44 divisors ( 11, 22, 44, 88 )  and hence the resultant value of NN will be 11 and 11 has only 11 divisor hence answer is 11.   
Example case 3: We can divide N=30N=30 by 66, 1010 or 1515 as all three of them have exactly 44 divisors. In each case resultant value of NN will be either 55, 33 or 22. And all three of them has exactly 22 divisors and they cannot be divided further. Hence the output is 22.     
Example case 4: One of the optimal ways to divide N=120N=120 is divide 120120 by 88 followed by dividing  by 1515. The resultant value will be 120/8=15120/8=15 and 15/15=115/15=1. The number 11 has exactly one divisor and hence output is 11.
Note that, If we divided N=120N=120 by 66 then we won't get the optimal answer.       
Example case 5: We can divide N=45N=45 by 1515 and resultant value of NN will be 33. The number 33 has exactly 22 divisors and hence output is 22
