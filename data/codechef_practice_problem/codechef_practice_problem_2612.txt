Raj is a math pro and number theory expert. One day, he met his age-old friend Chef. Chef claimed to be better at number theory than Raj, so Raj gave him some fuzzy problems to solve. In one of those problems, he gave Chef a 33-tuple of non-negative integers (a0,b0,c0)(a0,b0,c0) and told Chef to convert it to another tuple (x,y,z)(x,y,z).
Chef may perform the following operations any number of times (including zero) on his current tuple (a,b,c)(a,b,c), in any order:

Choose one element of this tuple, i.e. aa, bb or cc. Either add 11 to that element or subtract 11 from it. The cost of this operation is 11.
Merge: Change the tuple to (a−1,b−1,c+1)(a−1,b−1,c+1), (a−1,b+1,c−1)(a−1,b+1,c−1) or (a+1,b−1,c−1)(a+1,b−1,c−1), i.e. add 11 to one element and subtract 11 from the other two. The cost of this operation is 00.
Split: Change the tuple to (a−1,b+1,c+1)(a−1,b+1,c+1), (a+1,b−1,c+1)(a+1,b−1,c+1) or (a+1,b+1,c−1)(a+1,b+1,c−1), i.e. subtract 11 from one element and add 11 to the other two. The cost of this operation is also 00.

After each operation, all elements of Chef's tuple must be non-negative. It is not allowed to perform an operation that would make one or more elements of this tuple negative.
Can you help Chef find the minimum cost of converting the tuple (a0,b0,c0)(a0,b0,c0) to the tuple (x,y,z)(x,y,z)? It can be easily proved that it is always possible to convert any tuple of non-negative integers to any other.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers a0a0, b0b0, c0c0, xx, yy and zz.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost.

Explanation
Example case 1: The tuple (1,1,1)(1,1,1) can be converted to (2,2,2)(2,2,2) using only three Split operations, with cost 00: (1,1,1)→(2,0,2)→(1,1,3)→(2,2,2)(1,1,1)→(2,0,2)→(1,1,3)→(2,2,2).
Example case 2: We can use one addition operation and one Split operation: (1,2,3)→(1,3,3)→(2,4,2)(1,2,3)→(1,3,3)→(2,4,2).
