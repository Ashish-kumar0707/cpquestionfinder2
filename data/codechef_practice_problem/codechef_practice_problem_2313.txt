During a boring night at the restaurant, Chef decided to play with spaghetti. He has R−L+1R−L+1 spaghetti: exactly one spaghetti with each length between LL and RR inclusive.
Chef decided to take some of his spaghetti and stick them together to form one very long spaghetti. The length of this spaghetti is the sum of the lengths of the spaghetti he took. In particular, he may take all spaghetti and he may take only one spaghetti as well. How many different spaghetti can he make?
Two spaghetti are considered different if their lengths are different.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of different spaghetti Chef can make.
