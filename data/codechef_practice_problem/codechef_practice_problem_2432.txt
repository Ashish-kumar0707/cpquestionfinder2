The Euler totient function φ(N)φ(N) is defined as the number of integers between 11 and NN (inclusive) which are coprime with NN.
You are given NN and φ(N)φ(N). Calculate the prime factorization of NN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and φ(N)φ(N).

Output
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer KK — the number of distinct prime factors of NN. Then, print KK lines. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers pipi and eiei denoting a prime divisor of NN and its exponent. Specifically, the following conditions should hold:

N=∏Ki=1peiiN=∏i=1Kpiei
pi<pi+1pi<pi+1 for each valid ii
ei>0ei>0 for each valid ii
