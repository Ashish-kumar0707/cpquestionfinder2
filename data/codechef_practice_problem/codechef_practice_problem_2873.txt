Chefland is a country with NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by N−1N−1 bidirectional roads. It is possible to travel from each city to any other city using the roads. Moreover, each city is specialised in either black or white chocolate.
Chef wants to construct three new restaurants. However, he is still not sure where to build them. You should answer QQ queries; in each query, Chef gives you two cities LL and RR and you should find the number of ways to choose a set of three distinct cities that satisfies the following conditions:

The chosen cities belong to the shortest path between the cities LL and RR (both inclusive).
For any two chosen cities (let's denote them by uu and vv; u≠vu≠v), there is at least one city specialised in black chocolate on the shortest path between the cities uu and vv (both inclusive).

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For each valid ii, Ai=1Ai=1 if the ii-th city is specialised in black chocolate or 00 if it is specialised in white chocolate.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy denoting that cities xx and yy are connected by a road.
The next line contains a single integer QQ.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose three cities.
