Chef has recently learnt about the most amazing dish. The recipe for this dish lists two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN, and QQ tasks. Chef noticed that there are only three types of tasks:

Z Y: set BZ=YBZ=Y
L R X: for each ii such that L≤i≤RL≤i≤R, set Ai=BX+i−LAi=BX+i−L
L R: compute the sum AL+AL+1+…+ARAL+AL+1+…+AR

Chef must perform all the tasks in the given order if he wants to master cooking the most amazing dish. He set out to perform all the tasks, but soon realised that there are too many of them! Since Chef does not want to miss his favourite TV show, you should help him perform all the tasks written on the recipe.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
The next QQ lines describe the tasks. Each of these lines contains an integer TT denoting the type of the current task, followed by a space and the parametres of this task in the following format:
if T=1T=1, two space-separated integers ZZ and YY
if T=2T=2, three space-separated integers LL, RR and XX
if T=3T=3, two space-separated integers LL and RR

Output
For each task of type 3, print a single line containing one integer — the required sum.

Explanation
In the second, fourth and sixth task, you should compute the current sum of all elements of AA.
After performing the first task, A=[0,1,2,0,0]A=[0,1,2,0,0] and B=[1,2,3,4,5]B=[1,2,3,4,5].
After the third task, A=[0,1,2,0,0]A=[0,1,2,0,0] and B=[1,2,2,4,5]B=[1,2,2,4,5].
After the fifth task, A=[1,2,2,4,5]A=[1,2,2,4,5] and B=[1,2,2,4,5]B=[1,2,2,4,5].
