You are given NN strings S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SN. Consider a complete undirected graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN), in which the weight of an edge between vertices uu and vv is equal to the length of the longest common substring of SuSu and SvSv.
Find the maximum possible weight of a spanning tree of this graph.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string SiSi.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum weight of a spanning tree.
Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1001≤N≤100
for each valid ii, SiSi contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1055⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1025⋅102
Subtask #2 (20 points): the sum of lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1035⋅103
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The strings S2,S3S2,S3 have a longest common substring with length 22, and the strings S1,S3S1,S3 have a longest common substring with length 22. The spanning tree which contains the edges (2,3)(2,3) and (1,3)(1,3) has the maximum weight 44.
