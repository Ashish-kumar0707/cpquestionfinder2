An NN-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence F1,F2,…F1,F2,… such that for each integer i>Ni>N, Fi is calculated as f(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N), where f is some function. A XOR N-bonacci sequence is an N-bonacci sequence for which f(Fi−1,Fi−2,…,Fi−N)=Fi−1⊕Fi−2⊕…⊕Fi−N, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Recently, Chef has found an interesting sequence S1,S2,…, which is obtained from prefix XORs of a XOR N-bonacci sequence F1,F2,…. Formally, for each positive integer i, Si=F1⊕F2⊕…⊕Fi. You are given the first N elements of the sequence F, which uniquely determine the entire sequence S.
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given an index k and you should calculate Sk. It is guaranteed that in each query, Sk does not exceed 1050.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers F1,F2,…,FN.
The following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer k.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer Sk.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Fi≤109 for each i such that 1≤i≤N
1≤k≤109
