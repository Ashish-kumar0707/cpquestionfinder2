Chef received an array AA of NN integers as a valentine's day present. He wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence by choosing a subarray and adding a fixed integer XX to all its elements.
More formally, Chef wants to maximize the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of AA by performing the following operation at most once:

Pick 33 integers L,RL,R and X (1≤L≤R≤N, X∈ℤ)X (1≤L≤R≤N, X∈Z) and assign Ai:=Ai+X ∀ i∈[L,R]Ai:=Ai+X ∀ i∈[L,R].

Find the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain after performing the operation at most once.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer NN, the size of the array.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers, where the ithith integer denotes AiAi.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the length of the longest strictly increasing sequence Chef can obtain.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 11: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(3,3,2)(L,R,X)=(3,3,2). On performing the operation, AA becomes [1,2,3][1,2,3]. The LIS of the updated array has length 33. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,3][1,2,3].
Test case 22: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(2,3,−3)(L,R,X)=(2,3,−3). On performing the operation, AA becomes [1,2,5,6,9][1,2,5,6,9]. The LIS of the updated array has length 55. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,5,6,9][1,2,5,6,9].
Test case 33: Chef can pick (L,R,X)=(4,4,4)(L,R,X)=(4,4,4). On performing the operation, AA becomes [1,2,2,5][1,2,2,5]. The LIS of the updated array has length 33. The elements of the LIS are [1,2,5][1,2,5].
