Chef, who is a chef by profession as well, has created NN pies (enumerated 11 through NN) and has placed them in a row. Now he wants to taste all the pies, but by following a rather peculiar order of tasting.
At each step, he chooses (uniformly randomly and independently) either the current leftmost pie or the rightmost pie, and eats that pie.
For example, if N=7N=7, then one valid order of tasting the pies is (1,2,7,3,4,6,5)(1,2,7,3,4,6,5). However, (1,2,7,6,4,5,3)(1,2,7,6,4,5,3) is not a valid order.
Chef can't wait to taste all the pies, so for each ii (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N), he wants to know the expected value of the number of steps he'll need to eat the ithith pie.
It can be shown that each expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQPQ. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7109+7, where Q−1Q−1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of QQ under 109+7109+7
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer NN — the number of pies.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers, the ithith of which is the expected number of steps Chef needs to eat the ithith pie.

Explanation
Test case 11: 
There are 33 ways of eating the 1st1st pie:

(1)(1) : The probability of this ordering is 1212 and number of steps is 11
(3,1)(3,1) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 22
(3,2,1)(3,2,1) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 33

Therefore, the expected number of steps for the 1st1st pie is 12⋅1+14⋅2+14⋅3=7412⋅1+14⋅2+14⋅3=74
There are 44 ways of eating the 2nd2nd pie:

(1,2)(1,2) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 22
(3,2)(3,2) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 22
(1,3,2)(1,3,2) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 33
(3,1,2)(3,1,2) : The probability of this ordering is 1414 and number of steps is 33

Therefore, the expected number of steps for the 2nd2nd pie is 14⋅2+14⋅2+14⋅3+14⋅3=5214⋅2+14⋅2+14⋅3+14⋅3=52
