Chef is playing a game with two sequences of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM. He has an integer VV, which is initially equal to 00. Chef will play for a number of turns he chooses (possibly zero); he stops playing when he gets bored. In each turn of the game, Chef must perform one of the following operations:

Choose an integer XX from AA and change VV to V∨XV∨X, i.e. the bitwise OR of VV and XX.
Choose an integer XX from BB and change VV to V∧XV∧X, i.e. the bitwise AND of VV and XX.

Find the number of possible distinct values which VV can have after the game ends.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains MM space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible values of VV after the game ends.
