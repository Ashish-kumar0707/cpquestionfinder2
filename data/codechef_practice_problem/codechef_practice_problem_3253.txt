Chef has a binary string SS of length NN.
He can perform the following operation on string SS: 

Select a substring of size MM and flip all the characters of the selected substring, i.e., change 00 to 11 and 11 to 00.

There are QQ queries of the following 22 types: 

00: Append 00 to the front of string SS.
11: Append 11 to the front of string SS.

After each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make lexicographically smallest possible string from SS. Note that queries are dependent. Thus, after each query, the string SS gets updated.
Note: The input of this problem is large, so use fast input/output methods.
Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers NN, MM, and QQ.
The second line of each test case contains the string SS. 
After that, QQ lines follow. The ithith line contains an integer XX (0≤X≤1)(0≤X≤1) - the ithith query. For each query, you need to append XX to the front of string SS.

Output Format
For each test case, print QQ lines. The ithith line should contain the answer to the ithith query.
Constraints

1≤Q≤1051≤Q≤105
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106.
Sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 106106.

Explanation
Test Case 11: Initially, S=10011S=10011. 

After the first query, SS becomes 110011110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which SS can be converted is 000000000000. The string 110011110011 can be converted to 000000000000 using 22 operations:

Operation 11: Select the subarray [1,2][1,2] and flip it. Now, SS becomes 000011000011.
Operation 22: Select the subarray [5,6][5,6] and flip it. Now, SS becomes 000000000000.
It can be proven that 110011110011 cannot be converted into 000000000000 in less than 22 operations.
After the second query, SS becomes 01100110110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which SS can be converted is 00000000000000. The string 01100110110011 can be converted to 00000000000000 using 22 operations:

Operation 11: Select the subarray [2,3][2,3] and flip it. Now, SS becomes 00000110000011.
Operation 22: Select the subarray [6,7][6,7] and flip it. Now, SS becomes 00000000000000.
It can be proven that 01100110110011 cannot be converted into 00000000000000 in less than 22 operations.
After the third query, SS becomes 1011001110110011. The lexicographically minimum string into which SS can be converted is 0000000100000001. The string 1011001110110011 can be converted to 0000000100000001 using 55 operations: These operations are [1,2][1,2], [2,3][2,3], [4,5][4,5], [5,6][5,6], and [6,7][6,7] in the given order.
It can be proven that SS cannot be converted into a lexicographically smaller string than 0000000100000001 using any number of operations.
Also, it can be proven that 1011001110110011 cannot be converted into 0000000100000001 in less than 55 operations.
