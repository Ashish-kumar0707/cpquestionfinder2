Chef works in a similar way to a travelling salesman ― he always travels to new cities in order to sell his delicious dishes.
Today, Chef is planning to visit NN cities (numbered 11 through NN). There is a direct way to travel between each pair of cities. Each city has a specific temperature; let's denote the temperature in the ii-th city by CiCi. Chef has a fixed temperature tolerance DD with the following meaning: for each pair of cities aa and bb, he may travel from city aa directly to city bb only if |Ca−Cb|≤D|Ca−Cb|≤D, otherwise he would catch a heavy flu because of the sudden change in temperature.
Chef starts from city 11. Is he able to visit all NN cities in such a way that each city is visited exactly once?
Notes:

Chef is not able to travel through a city without visiting it.
City 11 is visited at the beginning.
It is not necessary to be able to travel directly to city 11 from the last city Chef visits.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and DD.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if Chef can visit all cities or "NO" (without quotes) if he cannot.
