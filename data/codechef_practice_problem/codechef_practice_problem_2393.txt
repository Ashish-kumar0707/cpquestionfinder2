This problem's statement is really a short one.
You are given an integer S. Consider an infinite sequence S, 2S, 3S, ... . Find the first number in this sequence that can be represented as Q3, where Q is some positive integer number. As the sought number could be very large, please print modulo (109 + 7).
The number S will be given to you as a product of N positive integer numbers A1, A2, ..., AN, namely S = A1 * A2 * ... * AN
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
Then there is a line, containing N space separated integers, denoting the numbers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the first term of the sequence which is the perfect cube, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
(Subtask 1): N = 1, 1 ≤ S ≤ 109 - 15 points.
(Subtask 2): N = 1, 1 ≤ S ≤ 1018 - 31 point.
(Subtask 3): 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1018 - 54 points.

8
216


Explanation
Example case 1. First few numbers in the infinite sequence 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, , etc. In this sequence, 8 is the first number which is also a cube (as 23 = 8).
Example case 2. First few numbers in the infinite sequence 6, 12, 18, 24, , etc. In this sequence, 216 is the first number which is also a cube (as 63 = 216).
