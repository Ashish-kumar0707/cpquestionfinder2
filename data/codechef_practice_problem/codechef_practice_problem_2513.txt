You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and an integer KK. Determine if it is possible to reorder the elements of the sequence AA into a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN and choose a real number mm in such a way that for each contiguous subsequence of BB with length KK, the arithmetic average of the elements of this subsequence is mm. If it is possible, find one such reordered subsequence BB.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to reorder the elements of AA in the required way, or "NO" otherwise.
If it is possible, print a second line containing NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.
