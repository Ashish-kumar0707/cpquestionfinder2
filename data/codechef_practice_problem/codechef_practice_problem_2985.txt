You are trying to create an array AA containing NN integers. However, your array-creating-machine has some restrictions. More formally, you are given a constant DD, and two arrays BB and CC, each with MM elements, then:

Ai≤DAi≤D for all 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N
Ai≥Ai−1Ai≥Ai−1 for all 1<i≤N1<i≤N
ACj⋅Bj≤DACj⋅Bj≤D for all 1≤j≤M1≤j≤M

Find how many different arrays can you create. Since answer can be big, print it modulo 
998244353998244353.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains 33 integers NN, MM, and DD - the length of the array AA you need to create, the length of BB and CC, the constant from the statement.
The ii-th line of the next MM lines of each test case contains two integers CiCi and BiBi.

Output Format
For each test case output a single integer - the number of different arrays you can create modulo 998244353998244353.

Explanation

Test case 11: One array is {1,1,1,1}{1,1,1,1} and for each value of last element from 22 to 66, there are 33 possible combinations of first three values: {1,1,1}{1,1,1}, {1,1,2}{1,1,2}, {1,2,2}{1,2,2}. Therefore there are a total of 1+5⋅3=161+5⋅3=16 possible arrays.
