You are given two sets of segments on a line, AA and BB. Set AA contains NN segments (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the ii-th of these segments is SA,i=[LA,i,RA,i]SA,i=[LA,i,RA,i]. Set BB contains MM segments (numbered 11 through MM); for each valid ii, the ii-th of these segments is SB,i=[LB,i,RB,i]SB,i=[LB,i,RB,i]. 
Find ∑Ni=1∑Mj=1|SA,i∩SB,j|∑i=1N∑j=1M|SA,i∩SB,j|, where |SA,i∩SB,j||SA,i∩SB,j| denotes the length of the intersection of the ii-th segment from set AA and the jj-th segment from set BB. Note that the length of a segment [l,r][l,r] is r−lr−l.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LA,iLA,i and RA,iRA,i.
MM more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LB,iLB,i and RB,iRB,i.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the value of the sum.

Explanation
Example case 1: The intersection of SA,1SA,1 and SB,1SB,1 is the segment [1,2][1,2]. The intersection of SA,2SA,2 and SB,2SB,2 is [3,4][3,4]. Both remaining intersections have lengths 00, so the sum is 1+1=21+1=2.
Example case 2: The only two segments have an empty intersection, which has length 00.
Example case 3: The segment [5,8][5,8] is covered by both sets of segments, so the sum is 33.
