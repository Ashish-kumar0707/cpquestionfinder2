You are given an integer N≥2N≥2. Construct string SS of length NN containing only lowercase Latin alphabets, such that

SS contains at least 22 distinct characters.
The number of circular shifts of SS which are palindromes is maximum among all strings of length NN containing at least 22 distinct characters.

If there are multiple possible strings satisfying this condition, you may print any of them.
Note that a string of length NN has exactly NN circular shifts - even if some of them might be equal as strings, they are considered to be different shifts as long as they are obtained by shifting SS by different amounts. For example, 𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋ababab has 66 circular shifts even though they only form 22 distinct strings between them (namely 𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋ababab and 𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚊bababa).
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer NN - the length of the string to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the string SS you construct.
Note: You will get a Wrong Answer verdict if any of the following cases occur:

The length of the output string is not equal to NN.
The output string has characters other than lowercase Latin alphabets, i.e, [a−z][a−z].
The output string has all characters the same.
There exists a string S′S′ of length NN with at least 22 distinct characters, such that the output string has strictly fewer circular shifts being palindromes than S′S′ does.

Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
2≤N≤2⋅1052≤N≤2⋅105
Sum of NN over all tests is atmost 2⋅1052⋅105.
SS must contain only lowercase Latin alphabets.
SS must contain at least 22 distinct characters.

Explanation
Test Case 11: No palindrome is possible with a string of length 22 having 22 distinct characters.
Test Case 22: At most one circular shift of a string of length 33 can be a palindrome. For the given string 𝚐𝚌𝚌gcc, the circular shifts are {𝚐𝚌𝚌, 𝚌𝚐𝚌, 𝚌𝚌𝚐}{gcc, cgc, ccg} of which only 𝚌𝚐𝚌cgc is a palindrome.
Test Case 33: At most two circular shifts of a string of length 66 can be a palindrome. For the given string 𝚊𝚋𝚌𝚌𝚋𝚊abccba, the circular shifts are {𝚊𝚋𝚌𝚌𝚋𝚊, 𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚌𝚌𝚋, 𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚌𝚌, 𝚌𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋𝚌, 𝚌𝚌𝚋𝚊𝚊𝚋, 𝚋𝚌𝚌𝚋𝚊𝚊}{abccba, aabccb, baabcc, cbaabc, ccbaab, bccbaa}, out of which only the first and fourth strings are palindromes.
