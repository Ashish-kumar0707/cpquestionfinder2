You are given a directed graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM weighted edges. For each vertex of the graph, find the minimum cost of a walk that passes through this vertex, or determine that the minimum does not exist, i.e. for any integer mm, there is a walk with cost smaller than mm.
Notes:

A walk in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices v1,v2,…,vKv1,v2,…,vK for some positive integer KK, and an associated (possibly empty) sequence of edges e1,e2,…,eK−1e1,e2,…,eK−1 such that for each valid ii, edge eiei goes from vertex vivi to vertex vi+1vi+1.
The cost of a walk is the sum of weights of edges e1,e2,…,eK−1e1,e2,…,eK−1; if K=1K=1, the cost is 00.
A walk passes through vertex uu if uu belongs to the sequence v1,v2,…,vKv1,v2,…,vK.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
Each of the next MM lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww describing an edge from vertex uu to vertex vv with weight ww.

Output
For each test case, print NN lines. For each valid ii, if the minimum cost of a walk through vertex ii does not exist, the ii-th of these lines should contain the string "INF". Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the minimum cost.
