Zanka finds fun in everyday simple things. One fine day he got interested in a very trivial sequence. Given a natural number kk, he considers the sequence Ai=k+i2Ai=k+i2 so that the terms are
k+1,k+4,k+9,k+16,…k+1,k+4,k+9,k+16,…
Now to make things more interesting, he considers the gcdgcd of consecutive terms in the sequence, then takes the sum of the first 2k2k values. More formally, he wants to compute
∑i=12kgcd(Ai,Ai+1)∑i=12kgcd(Ai,Ai+1)
Denote this sum by SS. Zanka wants you to print  the number SS for each kk.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer kk.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the sum SS for the given kk.

Explanation
The first 2k+12k+1 terms of the sequence AA are 2,5,102,5,10.
So the answer is gcd(2,5)+gcd(5,10)=1+5=6gcd(2,5)+gcd(5,10)=1+5=6
