Let's define an elephant tree with size NN as a rooted tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) such that:

vertex 11 is the root
for any three vertices uu, vv and ww such that u<v<wu<v<w, if ww is a (direct or indirect) descendant of uu, then vv is also a descendant of uu

Little Chef has an elephant tree with size NN. Today, he wants to use the leaves of this tree to decorate QQ dishes (a leaf is a vertex with no children). For each dish, he picks some range [L,R][L,R] and he wants to uniformly randomly choose a pair of distinct leaves with labels between LL and RR inclusive. These leaves are removed and used to decorate the dish; since the tree is magical, the removed leaves grow back immediately.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, Chef is decorating one dish and wants to know the expected value of the distance between the chosen leaves. It can be proved that if at least one pair of leaves can be chosen, this expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/DP/D, where PP and DD are coprime positive integers and DD is coprime to 998,244,353998,244,353.
The answer to a query is 00 if there is at most one leaf in the given range (no pair of leaves can be chosen) or P⋅D−1P⋅D−1 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 otherwise, where D−1D−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of DD modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.
Little Chef is very unpredictable, so you have to answer each query immediately after he gives it to you.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains N−1N−1 space-separated integers f2,f3,…,fNf2,f3,…,fN. For each valid ii, fifi denotes the parent of vertex ii.
The following QQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy. Let's denote the answer to the previous query by ansans (if this is the first query, ans=0ans=0). Then, the parameters LL and RR can be computed as L=x⊕ansL=x⊕ans and R=y⊕ansR=y⊕ans.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.

Explanation
The leaves are vertices 33, 66, 77, 99 and 1010.

In the first query, L=2L=2, R=10R=10 and the expected value is 21/521/5.
In the second query, L=1L=1, R=10R=10 and the expected value is 21/521/5 again.
In the third query, L=2L=2, R=9R=9 and the expected value is 13/313/3.
