Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN. For each valid ii, CiCi is the colour of AiAi.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query:

You are given two colours xx and yy.
Consider the subsequence of AA which contains only elements AiAi such that Ci=xCi=x or Ci=yCi=y (in the original order). Let's denote it by BB.
For each contiguous subsequence of BB (including empty subsequence), consider the sum of all its elements. Find the maximum of these sums. 

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN.
QQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of BB.
