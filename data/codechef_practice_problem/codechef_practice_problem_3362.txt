Chef is working on a small project ― he is building a cyberorganism. In his current design, the cyberorganism is an N×N×NN×N×N cube consisting of N3N3 cells. Let's denote the cells by (x,y,z)(x,y,z), where 1≤x,y,z≤N1≤x,y,z≤N.
Chef is currently working on the cyberorganism's self-defense mechanism against viruses. So far, he has figured out that viruses behave in the following way:

When the cyberorganism is infected by a virus, some of its cells immediately become infected, while the remaining ones stay healthy (so far).
Afterwards, the virus spreads itself. Whenever there is an infected cell (x,y,z)(x,y,z), the cells (x+1,y,z)(x+1,y,z), (x,y+1,z)(x,y+1,z) and (x,y,z+1)(x,y,z+1) become infected as well (if they exist, i.e. the infection does not propagate outside the cyberorganism).
The virus continues spreading itself until there are no more cells that can be infected this way.

Chef noticed that it is possible for the cyberorganism to reorganise itself right after the initial infection (before the virus starts spreading). The cyberorganism can use this opportunity to make itself less vulnerable to the virus (i.e. minimise the number of infected cells after the virus finishes spreading).
The cyberorganism can reorganise itself by changing the order of the rows, columns and layers of its cells. In other words, it can choose three permutations P,Q,RP,Q,R of the integers 11 through NN (each permutation can be chosen independently from the other two) and reorganise itself in such a way that for each valid x,y,zx,y,z, the cell (Px,Qy,Rz)(Px,Qy,Rz) before the reorganisation becomes the cell (x,y,z)(x,y,z) afterwards. If this cell was infected before the reorganisation, then it remains infected afterwards, and if it was healthy, it remains healthy afterwards ― only the coordinates of the infected and healthy cells change.
Chef has struggled for some time with an efficient self-defense mechanism and now, he has decided to ask for your help. You are given the coordinates of the cells that are infected initially. Determine how to reorganise the cyberorganism in order to minimise the number of cells that are infected after the virus finishes spreading.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
N2N2 lines follow, where each block of NN lines describes a layer of the cube. Each of these lines contains a string with length NN. For each valid x,y,zx,y,z, the xx-th character on the (z−1)N+y(z−1)N+y-th line is '1' if the cell (x,y,z)(x,y,z) is initially infected or '0' if this cell is initially healthy.

Output
Print three lines.

The first line should contain NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.
The second line should contain NN space-separated integers Q1,Q2,…,QNQ1,Q2,…,QN.
Finally, the third line should contain NN space-separated integers R1,R2,…,RNR1,R2,…,RN.

Constraints

3≤N≤1003≤N≤100
all strings on the input contain only characters '0' and '1'
initially, there is at least one healthy cell

Scoring
In each test case (and therefore each test file), let CC be the number of initially infected cells and KK be the number of healthy cells after the virus stops spreading. If K=0K=0, your submission will receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, your score for this test case is equal to K⋅(CN3)1.5K⋅(CN3)1.5. The score of a submission is equal to the sum of its scores over all test cases. The goal is to maximise the score of your submission.
There are 20 test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly four test files (numbered 2, 7, 12 and 17, see the Test Generation section), i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 20% (4 / 20) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other 16 test files.

Explanation
After reorganising, the state of the cyberorganism is (using the same format as on the input, with an extra line between each two blocks of NN lines)

After the virus spreads, the state of the cyberorganism becomes

There are 99 infected cells in the initial state and 1111 healthy cells in the final state, so the score of this output is 11⋅(933)1.5≈2.11711⋅(933)1.5≈2.117.
Test generation

N=100N=100 in all test cases (except for the example).
There are 20 test cases (numbered 00 through 1919). In all test cases, the strings describing the initial state are generated independently and randomly.
For each valid kk, each cell in the kk-th test case is initially infected with probability PP or healthy with probability 1−P1−P, where P=0.8k+3P=0.8k+3 is fixed.
