A good number is a positive integer which is not divisible by the cube (third power) of any prime. For example, 22, 33, 25=5⋅525=5⋅5, 63=7⋅963=7⋅9 and 2057=11⋅11⋅172057=11⋅11⋅17 are good numbers, but 8=2⋅2⋅28=2⋅2⋅2, 9317=7⋅11⋅11⋅119317=7⋅11⋅11⋅11 and 2401=7⋅7⋅7⋅72401=7⋅7⋅7⋅7 are not good numbers.
A pair of positive integers (x,y)(x,y) is special if x⋅yx⋅y is a good number. A set of positive integers is nice if each pair of different integers from this set is special. In particular, the empty set is nice.
You are given a set of integers {A1,A2,…,AN}{A1,A2,…,AN}. Find the number of nice subsets of this set.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of nice subsets.
