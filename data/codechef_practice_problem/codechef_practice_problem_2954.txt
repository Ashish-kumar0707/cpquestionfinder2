You are given a simple undirected graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges. Consider the following process performed for a fixed number of seconds:

Each second, choose an unordered pair of vertices (a,b)(a,b) uniformly randomly (there are N(N−1)/2N(N−1)/2 such pairs).
If the edge (a,b)(a,b) is present in the graph, remove it. Otherwise, add it to the graph.

We are interested in the number of spanning trees in the resulting graph. Two spanning trees are distinct if they contain different sets of edges. Note that the resulting graph may be disconnected, in which case the number of spanning trees is 00. The initial graph does not have to be connected either.
You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given a time TT and you have to find the expected number of spanning trees in the graph after the process described above is performed for TT seconds, modulo 109+7109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N,MN,M and QQ.
Each of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.
Each of the next QQ lines contains a single integer TT describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the expected number of spanning trees modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Initially, the graph is a tree, so it has a single spanning tree, so the answer to the first query is 11.
After one second, exactly one edge has been "toggled". If this edge was initially present in the graph (with probability 2/32/3), we have no spanning tree afterwards, otherwise (with probability 1/31/3) we have 33 spanning trees (since we get a complete graph on 33 vertices). The expected value is still 11.
Both after two seconds and after three seconds, the expected number of spanning trees is 7979. The multiplicative inverse of 99 modulo 109+7109+7 is 111,111,112111,111,112. Therefore, we print 7⋅111,111,1127⋅111,111,112 modulo 109+7109+7, which is 777,777,784777,777,784.
