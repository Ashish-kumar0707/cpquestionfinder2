Doctor Kunj installed new software on cyborg Shresth.
This software introduced Shresth to range minimum queries.
Cyborg Shresth thought of TT different problems in each of which you will be given
an array AA of length NN and an array BB of length MM. In each of these problems, you have to calculate:
∑mi=1∑mj=irangeMin(B[i],B[j])∑i=1m∑j=imrangeMin(B[i],B[j])
Where rangeMin(i,j)rangeMin(i,j) returns the minimum element in the range of indices ii to jj (both included) in array AA.
It is given that array BB consists of pairwise distinct elements and is in ascending order.
Input Format:

First line will contain TT, the number of different problems Cyborg Shresth thought of.
Each problem's input data will be given in three different lines. 
The first line will contain NN and MM, the length of array AA and BB respectively. 
The second line will contain NN space separated positive integers, which form the array AA. - 
The third line will contain MM space separated positive integers, which form the array BB.

Output Format:

For each different problem, print on a new line the answer to the problem, i.e. the value of ∑mi=1∑mj=irangeMin(B[i],B[j])∑i=1m∑j=imrangeMin(B[i],B[j]) .

Constraints:

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤M≤1051≤M≤105
1≤A[i]≤1091≤A[i]≤109
1≤B[i]≤N1≤B[i]≤N

It is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106 .
Sample Input:
1
7 3
10 3 7 9 1 19 2
1 4 6

Sample Output:
43

Explanation:
For the given array AA, we have to calculate rangeMin(1,1)+rangeMin(1,4)+rangeMin(1,6)+rangeMin(4,4)+rangeMin(4,6)+rangeMin(6,6)rangeMin(1,1)+rangeMin(1,4)+rangeMin(1,6)+rangeMin(4,4)+rangeMin(4,6)+rangeMin(6,6).
This is equal to 10+3+1+9+1+19=4310+3+1+9+1+19=43.
