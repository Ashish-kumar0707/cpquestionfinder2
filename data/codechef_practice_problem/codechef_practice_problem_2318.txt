MoEngage has given you an array AA consisting of NN positive integers.
You should perform QQ queries of the following two types:

11 ii XX : Set AiAi to XX.
22 LL RR : Find the minimum non-negative integer KK such that the sequence [|AL−K|,|AL+1−K|,…,|AR−1−K|,|AR−K|][|AL−K|,|AL+1−K|,…,|AR−1−K|,|AR−K|] is sorted in non-decreasing order. Print −1−1 if no such KK exists.

For each query of type 22, output the minimum non-negative integer KK satisfying the constraint, or −1−1 if there isn't any.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers N,QN,Q.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
Then, the ithith of the next QQ lines contains three integers describing the queries 11 ii XX or 22 LL RR.

Output Format
For each query of type 22, output the minimum integer KK satisfying the constraint, or −1−1 if there isn't any in a new line.

Explanation

In the first query, selecting K=4K=4 makes the sequence [|A1−K|,|A2−K|,|A3−K|,|A4−K|,|A5−K|]=[1,1,2,2,4][|A1−K|,|A2−K|,|A3−K|,|A4−K|,|A5−K|]=[1,1,2,2,4]. This sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order. Also, there exists no value of KK less than 44 satisfying this.
In the second query, change A2=7A2=7. After the second query, the array AA becomes [5,7,2,6,0][5,7,2,6,0].
In the third query, there exists no value of KK satisfying the constraints.
