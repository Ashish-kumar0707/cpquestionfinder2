Chef has two sequences of integers (A1,A2,…,AN)(A1,A2,…,AN) and (B1,B2,…,BN)(B1,B2,…,BN).
A sequence of integers is beautiful if it contains only distinct integers. For each valid ii:

Chef wants to create a beautiful sequence SiSi. Let's denote the length of this sequence by LiLi and the sequence by Si,1,Si,2,…,Si,LiSi,1,Si,2,…,Si,Li.
The sequence SiSi is good if for each valid jj, Si,jSi,j is either equal to Ai+j−1Ai+j−1 or Bi+j−1Bi+j−1. Note that this means LiLi must be at most N−i+1N−i+1.
Let's denote the maximum possible value of LiLi (the maximum value such that some good sequence SiSi with this length exists) by MiMi.
Help Chef find the number of good sequences SiSi that have the maximum possible length MiMi. Since this number may be enormous, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of possible sequences SiSi modulo 109+7109+7.
