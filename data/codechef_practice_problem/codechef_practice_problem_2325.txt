A famous student of AESC MSU, as you know, comes from Kostomuksha. Kostomuksha has a popular game called Doka.
The essence of Doka is as follows:
You are given an array AA and an integer XX. You want to calculate how many subarrays of this array have a geometric mean of XX. 
Formally, calculate the number of pairs of integers (L,R)(L,R) such that 1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N and
AL⋅AL+1⋅…⋅AR‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√R−L+1=XAL⋅AL+1⋅…⋅ARR−L+1=X
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,XN,X — the size of the array AA and the required geometric mean.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, on a new line print the number of subarrays that satisfy the condition.
Constraints

1≤T≤1031≤T≤103
1≤N≤2⋅1051≤N≤2⋅105
1≤X,Ai≤1091≤X,Ai≤109
Sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 11: Every subarray has a geometric mean of 33, and there are 66 subarrays in total so the answer is 66.
Test case 22: The only subarray with a geometric mean of 44 is the singleton array [4][4], obtained with L=R=4L=R=4.
Test case 33: The 66 pairs of (L,R)(L,R) which have a geometric mean of 5454 are:

(1,2)(1,2), giving the subarray [36,81][36,81]
(1,3)(1,3), giving the subarray [36,81,54][36,81,54]
(1,4)(1,4), giving the subarray [36,81,54,54][36,81,54,54]
(3,3)(3,3), giving the subarray [54][54]
(3,4)(3,4), giving the subarray [54,54][54,54]
(4,4)(4,4), giving the subarray [54][54]
