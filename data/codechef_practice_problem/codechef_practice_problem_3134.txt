Chef lives in Treeland which, as the name implies, is shaped like a tree.
Chef's home, his school, and the playground where he likes to play are located on three different vertices in this tree. Chef tells you that every morning he walks across xx edges on the simple path from his home to his school. In the afternoon, he walks along the simple path from his school to the playground crossing yy edges. And in the evening, he walks back home across zz edges on the simple path from the playground to his home.
You have a map of Treeland where each vertex is labelled from 11 to nn. Find the number of triplets (a,b,c)(a,b,c) such that vertices a,b,ca,b,c could be Chef's home, his school and the playground respectively. If there is no such triplet, Chef may have miscounted some edges and you should output 00.
Input

The first line contains tt, the number of test cases. tt cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains four integers n,x,y,zn,x,y,z.
n−1n−1 lines follow, each with a pair of integers uu and vv denoting that there is an edge between uu and vv.

Output

For each testcase, output a single line containing the number of triplets which satisfy Chef's description.

Constraints

Explanation
Case 1: There are 4 possibilities as illustrated below. Consider the orange vertex as Chef's home, the green vertex as Chef's school, and the blue vertex as the playground.

Case 2: There are no triplets that satisfy Chef's description.
