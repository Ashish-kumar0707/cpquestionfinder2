Recently, Chef has moved to an evil land. In this land, there is only one bank, which offers NN savings plans (numbered 11 through NN).
Initially, Chef has 11 coin in his account. He may choose bank plans for as long as he wishes, in any order; each plan may be chosen any number of times. For each valid ii, whenever Chef chooses the ii-th savings plan, the number of coins in his bank account gets multiplied by the interest factor PiPi of this plan (whenever he chooses this plan again, the number of coins is multiplied by PiPi again).
Since the bank in the evil land is evil, it always stores the number of coins in each account modulo MM. Strangely, MM is a prime number.
Chef knows that he will win the lottery if the number of coins in his bank account becomes exactly FF. The bank does not want Chef to win, so it decided to remove some of the NN savings plans.
You are the head of the evil bank. Therefore, you need to remove some (possibly none or all) plans in such a way that Chef cannot win the lottery. Find the minimum number of plans you must remove.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and FF.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of plans to remove.

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef succeeds when he has 33 coins in his bank account. He can achieve that by choosing plan 11 and then plan 22, since he would get (2⋅4)%5=3(2⋅4)%5=3 coins.
It is enough to delete plan 11. Then, Chef cannot get 33 coins, since he can only multiply the number of coins in his account by 44.
Example case 3: Strangely, Chef succeeds when he has no coins in his bank account. The only way to achieve that is multiplying by 00, so it is enough to delete plan 55.
