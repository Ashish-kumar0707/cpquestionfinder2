Alice and Bob are playing a game. At the start of the game, there are NN piles of stones, the ii-th of which has AiAi stones.
Alice and Bob alternate moves. On their move, a player does the following:

Choose one pile of stones, and discard the remaining N−1N−1 piles.
Partition the stones in the chosen pile into exactly NN new piles of stones, each containing at least 11 stone. Note that this means that the number of piles is always NN.

The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner of the game if Alice moves first.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains NN, the number of piles.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For every test case print exactly one line containing the answer — either "Alice" or "Bob" (without the quotes).
You can output Alice and Bob in any case (for example, the strings BOb, BOB, bob and boB will be recognized as a positive response)

Alice


Explanation
In the first move, Alice can select the first pile and divide it into 33 piles of sizes 2,22,2, and 11. After this, Bob cannot make a move since each pile has less than 33 stones.
